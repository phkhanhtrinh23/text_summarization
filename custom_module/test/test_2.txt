 In order to help define this idea of love, several books and numerous research articles were consulted, and interviews were conducted with faculty of The University of Rhode Island. Research has concluded that the disciplines of biology, psychology, and philosophy are all important in analyzing love; however, more research needs to be done in order to define what love actually is, and how we can apply this knowledge in our everyday lives. In order to understand the brain's response to love, one must examine the brain and fully comprehend the myriad array of structures involved. Research has concluded, without a doubt that a person responds with their entire body when they feel desire. In addition to epinephrine, there are several other chemical responses released when a person experiences  love at first sight.  Endorphins, oxytocin, dopamine, and vasopressin are also important to examine when looking at the brain's response to love.  One brain study found that people in relationships for more than two years show increased activity in the reward area of the ventral pallidum, which is rich with vasopressin receptors.  (Pincott, 304) 10 LOVE In addition to the brain's response to the neurotransmitters and other  love  chemicals being released, there is also another very important aspect of chemistry that is responsible for the feeling of attraction. In addition to the biology of love, Dr. Zawia discussed the importance of the role of psychology in relationships. He stated that  a person is like an addictive drug.  While the importance of dopamine and addiction has already been discussed, Dr. Zawia explores this idea further, by stating  there is a reward punishment area of the brain responsible for people staying together.  The reward punishment concept will be discussed later in the psychology section of this research paper. When Dr. Zawia was asked which aspect of love played the greatest role in love, he stated  In the beginning, the most important part is biology, then, as love matures, psychology becomes the most important.  He also stated that  love is the most important emotion for people.  Psychology: Love as a form of hysteria While the biological components of love have been demonstrated as being extremely important, one must examine the psychology of love in order to get a full picture of this important human experience. In order to further examine this theory, we must create a hypothetical situation to examine from a Freudian perspective. In addition to Freud's view on love being developed during childhood and Maslow's idea that love is important enough to be included in the hierarchy of needs, there is another aspect of psychology that drives couples to stay together. In an interview with Dianne Kinsey, the concept of the psychology of love was discussed. When asked why people stay together, Ms. Kinsey stated that it was due to a  fear of loneliness.  This fear of loneliness keeps couples together, even when it might be best for all parties to ultimately separate. When asked which personality aspects a person must have in order to make their relationship work, Ms. Kinsey stated they need to be  flexible to change, and they need to be resilient.  These personality traits are especially important in making a marriage endure. When asked which aspect of love, biology, psychology, or philosophy, is the most important in a successful relationship; Ms. Kinsey stated that it is  a combination of all three.  She stated  love is the most powerful force in the entire world, but we have to start with ourselves.  Philosophy: The Essence of Love 22 LOVE Throughout this paper, all the books read, all the interviews conducted, one concept continually emerged, and that is  loving is part of the human condition.  We are inherently programmed to love, whether it's biologically, psychologically, or by some other mechanism we have yet to understand. In order to understand and answer these questions, it is imperative to travel through history, and to discuss how love was understood in the past. In an interview with William Krieger, the philosophical aspect of love was discussed. Dr. Krieger stated that  psychology started from philosophy , and that both of these disciplines are entangled. Dr. Krieger also agreed with Ms. Kinsey's idea that there is less of a stigma surrounding divorce in today's society. He stated that  years ago, women had no opportunities even less if you had kids.  In addition to the stigma surrounding divorce being lessened, Dr. Krieger also 25 LOVE stated that there is less stigma surrounding the concept of seeking therapy. Dr. Krieger also concurs with Dr. Zawia and Ms. Kinsey, insofar as he believes that love and successful marriages are due to a combination of biology, psychology and philosophical aspects. He stated that  neurochemistry is definitely important, but it's not all of it.  Dr. Krieger states that he absolutely believes in love and marriage, and that it is important to work together and change with the relationship in order to make it successful.
