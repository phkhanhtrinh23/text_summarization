 A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. A standard convolutional layer takes as input a Dp x Dy Xx M feature map F and produces a Dr x Dr x N feature map G where Dp is the spatial width and height of a square input feature map', M is the number of input channels (input depth), Dg is the spatial width and height of a Square output feature map and WN is the number of output channel (output depth). The standard convolutional layer is parameterized by convolution kernel K of size Dy x Dx x M x N where Dx is the spatial dimension of the kernel assumed to be square and   is number of input channels and N is the number of output channels as defined previously. The standard convolution operation has the effect of filtering features based on the convolutional kernels and combining features in order to produce a new representation. The standard convolutional filters in (a) are replaced by two layers: depthwise convolution in (b) and pointwise convolution in (c) to build a depthwise separable filter.
