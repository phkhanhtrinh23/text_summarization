 Functionalism, which seeks to provide a philosophical account of this level of abstraction, recognizes the possibility that systems as diverse as human beings, calculating machines and disembodied spirits could all have mental states. Functionalism is a difficult concept, and one way of coming to grips with it is to review the deficiencies of the dualist and materialist philosophies of mind it aims to displace. Nevertheless, many philosophers were initially drawn to radical behaviorism because, paradoxes and all, it seemed better than dualism. Nevertheless, the analogy between mental causation as construed by the logical behaviorist and physical causation goes only so far. According to this theory, mental events, states and processes are identical with neurophysiological events in the brain, and the property of being in a certain mental state (such as having a headache or believing it will rain) is identical with the property of being in a certain neurophysiological state. The central state identity theory acknowledges that it is possible for mental causes to interact causally without ever giving rise to any behavioral effect, as when a person thinks for a while about what he ought to do and then decides to do nothing. The central state identity theory provides a satisfactory account of what the mental terms in psychological explanations refer to, and so it is favored by psychologists who are dissatisfied with behaviorism. The identity theorist, on the other hand, argues that mental terms refer to neurophysiological states. The identity theory shows how the mentalistic explanations of psychology could be not mere heuristics but literal accounts of the causal history of behavior. The identity theorist, however, can live with the fact that "John has a headache" and "John is in such and such a brain state" are not synonymous. The identity theory can be held either as a doctrine about mental particulars (John's current pain or Bill's fear of animals) or as a doctrine about mental universals, or properties (having a pain or being afraid of animals). Token physicalism maintains only that all the mental particulars that happen to exist are neurophysiological, whereas type physicalism makes the more sweeping assertion that all the mental particulars there could possibly be are neurophysiological. Token physicalism does not rule out the logical possibility of machines and disembodied spirits having mental properties. Functionalism has apparently been able to resolve the dilemma. Functionalism construes the concept of causal role in such a way that a mental state can be defined by its causal relations to other mental states. Nevertheless, they are not behavioral dispositions because the consequences an input has for a machine in S1 or S2 are not specified solely in terms of the output of the machine. Nevertheless, the software description of a Coke machine does not logically require wheels, levers and diodes for its concrete realization. Functionalism allows for the possibility of disembodied Coke machines in exactly the same way and to the same extent that it allows for the possibility of disembodied minds. Functionalism is committed to defining mental states in terms of their causes and effects. Functionalists have made a few ingenious attempts to talk themselves and their colleagues out of this worry, but they have not, in my view, done so with much success. Functionalism has fared much better with the intentional content of mental states. Nevertheless, the most significant break with Hume's theory lies in the abandoning of resemblance as an explanation of the semantic properties of mental representations. According to the resemblance theory, entertaining the thought involves having a mental image that shows John to be tall. Nevertheless, the functionalist recognizes three types of causal relation among psychological states involving mental representations, and they might serve to fix the semantic properties of mental representations. Nevertheless, the concept may not be true. Nevertheless, the science of mental representation is now flourishing.
