The spacecraft will gradually go from a geostationary transfer orbit to a low lunar orbit, from which Chandrayaan-3 will descend to the lunar surface.\\nChandrayaan-3 is similar to India’s first lunar lander flown as part of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which crashed attempting a soft landing in September 2019. Chandrayaan-3 incorporates several revisions, such as additional fuel, based on the investigation into the failed landing.\\nThat crash took place five months after Beresheet, a spacecraft originally developed by Israeli non-profit organization SpaceIL to compete for the Google Lunar X Prize, crashed attempting its own lunar landing. SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries, which built the spacecraft, later said the lander crashed because one of its inertial measurement units malfunctioned.\\nSpaceIL announced its intent to pursue a second mission, called Beresheet 2. It would be significantly different from the original mission, with two smaller landers deployed from an orbiter. The mission had been slated to launch in 2025, a date confirmed in a January 2023 announcement of a joint statement of intent between the Israel Space Agency and NASA to cooperate on Beresheet 2. NASA agreed to provide an instrument and communications support for the mission.\\nThat schedule, and the mission itself, is now in question. Like the first mission, SpaceIL projected using philanthropic donations to fund Beresheet 2. However, in May a group of donors announced they were halting future payments to the project after spending $45 million, nearly half its estimated $100 million cost.\\nIn a statement representing the donors, Morris Kahn, a billionaire who also supported the original Beresheet mission, said the decision to halt future payments was not related to any problems with Beresheet 2. “These times obligate us to invest our resources and time in other philanthropic projects,” he stated.\\nSpaceIL said at the time it would seek alternative funding to continue the mission, but has provided no updates on those efforts since then. The organization did not respond to questions July 10 about the status of Beresheet 2.\\nIn a June 27 presentation at the European Lunar Symposium, Dan Blumberg, chairman of the Israel Space Agency, said work on Beresheet 2 was continuing for now. “We want to do more than we did in the previous one,” he said, including enhanced opportunities for international cooperation. In addition to the NASA agreement, SpaceIL has an agreement with the German agency DLR, which will provide a navigation system for the lander.\\nHe also emphasized educational outreach for the mission. Students will have opportunities to control the orbiter during its two-year mission, selecting regions on the surface to photograph, he said.\\nBlumberg hinted at SpaceIL’s financial problems in his brief talk, but did not go into details about funding for the mission. “There is a funding issue that we are still dealing with,” he said. “But we’re getting there.”\\n'}\n",

This was later verified by U.S. Space Force space tracking data, showing an object in a 431 by 461-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination of\\xa097.3 degrees.\\nThe Zhuque-2 mission carried no payload and the rocket’s first stage was not recovered. An unconfirmed number of payloads were lost in the launcher’s first flight in December 2022.\\xa0\\nZhuque-2 beats a range of other methalox rockets, including SpaceX’s Starship, the ULA Vulcan, Blue Origin’s New Glenn, Rocket Lab’s Neutron and Terran R from Relativity Space, in reaching orbit. These other launch vehicles will be much larger and feature much greater payload capacity.\\nA methane-liquid oxygen propellant mix offers advantages in performance and reduces issues of soot formation and coking for purposes of reusability.\\nThe successful launch also makes Landspace the second private Chinese launch firm to reach orbit with a liquid propellant rocket. This follows the success of Space Pioneer with its Tianlong-2 rocket in April this year.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/CNSAWatcher/status/1679006943698976768\\n\\nTaken together, the achievements indicate a breakthrough and growing level of maturity in Chinese commercial space launch efforts.\\nLandspace has already begun assembling its third Zhuque-2 (“Vermillion Bird-2”), indicating that another launch could come before the end of the year. Space Pioneer says it has multiple orders for launches for the Tianlong-2, and aims to launch the Falcon 9-class Tianlong-3 in the first half of 2024.\\nLandspace CEO Zhang Changwu told Chinese language Global Times tabloid that the company could now begin mass-producing the Zhuque-2, having finalized and verified its design.\\nLandspace’s Zhuque-2 is powered by gas generator engines producing 268 tons of thrust. Future Zhuque-2 launches with upgraded second stage engines will be capable of delivering a 6,000-kilogram payload capacity to a 200-kilometer low Earth orbit (LEO), or 4,000 kilograms to 500-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), according to Landspace.\\nThe rocket has a diameter of 3.35 meters—the same as a number of national Long March rockets—and a take-off mass of 219 tons.\\xa0\\nThe rocket is currently expendable but Landspace is working on a restartable version of the 80-ton-thrust TQ-12 engine which powers the Zhuque-2 first stage.\\xa0\\n\\nView from above:https://t.co/2pY1F2mgFW pic.twitter.com/GDAj7uWqS7— Cosmic Penguin (@Cosmic_Penguin) July 12, 2023\\n\\nLandspace is one of China’s first commercial rocket firms. It was established in 2015, soon after the Chinese government opened up parts of the space sector to private capital in late 2014, which is seen to be a reaction to developments in the U.S.\\xa0\\nIt is also one of the best-funded Chinese launch firms, but the company’s journey to orbit has not been smooth. Its first launch, which took place in October 2018, used the smaller and simpler solid-propellant Zhuque-1. The mission ended in failure, and the company announced it would not repeat the attempt and instead focus on its methane-fueled Zhuque-2.\\nThe company has however built up infrastructure during this time. Landspace has set up an intelligent manufacturing base in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province and established a $1.5 billion medium and large-scale liquid rocket assembly and test plant at Jiaxing, also in Zhejiang.\\nThe company is now in a position to secure contracts for the Zhuque-2 but faces a field of competition. Other Chinese firms, including iSpace, Galactic Energy and Deep Blue Aerospace, are working on their own, reusable liquid propellant rockets.\\nSpace Pioneer and other later movers such as OrienSpace are developing larger rockets which are targeting contracts to launch batches of satellites for China’s national satellite internet megaconstellation project, named Guowang.\\nChina recently opened a call for space station commercial cargo proposals, further indicating that commercial firms will have a growing role to play in the country’s space sector.\\nThe Zhuque-2 launch was China’s 27th orbital mission of 2023, with a total of more than 70 launches planned from state-owned main space contractor CASC and commercial players. Landspace, Space Pioneer, Galactic Energy, iSpace and Expace have so far complemented national launches this year.\\n'}\n",

As evidence, the term surpasses 300 mentions in the Space Force’s 2024 budget documents. \\n“It’s amazing how many times you see the word resiliency in the budget justification materials,” said analyst Sam Wilson of the Aerospace Corporation’s Center for Space Policy and Strategy. \\nThe emphasis on resilience — or adaptability in the face of attacks — reflects the priorities set by the new chief of space operations Gen. Chance Saltzman. The running theme in the budget is the need to ensure U.S. access to space and shore up capabilities to compete with space powers like China and Russia. \\n“China, our pacing challenge, is the most immediate threat in, to, and from space for which the Space Force must maintain technological advantage,” Saltzman said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year. \\n“Russia, while less capable, remains an acute threat that is developing asymmetric counter-space systems meant to neutralize American satellites,” said Saltzman. \\n‘Competitive endurance’ \\nA push for resilience is part of a multifaceted strategy Saltzman rolled out in March called “competitive endurance” to guide Space Force plans to deter and combat adversaries. \\nVice Chief of Space Operations Gen. David “DT” Thompson said the Space Force’s central responsibility is ensuring U.S. military forces and allies have access to satellite services. \\nAnd that is why resilience is so critical, he said June 15 at the Defense One Tech Summit. \\n“Ukraine showed that proliferation works. It leads to resilient architectures,” Thompson said, referring to Russia’s repelled attempts to jam SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellite service used by Ukrainian forces. \\nThe U.S. armed forces and allies today rely on a secure space infrastructure — for communications, early warnings of ballistic missile attacks and other services — that the Space Force provides from a relatively small number of geostationary satellites in harder to reach orbits. “And we have to continue to understand how to defend and protect those against counter-space attacks,” he said. \\n“I think that’s probably the biggest concern right now,” Thompson said, “ensuring we have enough resilience in both proliferated constellations, and those small numbers of larger systems to be able to defend them.”\\nA shift to proliferated constellations is already under way. \\nThe Space Development Agency — a procurement organization under the Space Force — is moving forward with a multibillion dollar plan to field a mesh network of satellites in low Earth orbit for missile warning and for data transport. The agency in April launched its first batch of 10 satellites and announced plans to launch its next 13 spacecraft in late July. \\nProliferation and redundancy make the loss of a few satellites tolerable, said Thompson, and bolster deterrence because targeting them imposes increased cost on an adversary. \\nThis is how the Space Force plans to deal with China’s threats in the long term, he said. “We are in a long competition with China. They absolutely believe that.” \\n“We can’t look at a finish line in this competition,” Thompson added. “We have to think what we need to do to compete for the next 10 to 50 years.” \\nLt. Gen. DeAnna Burt, chief operations officer of the U.S. Space Force, is briefed on NATO space operations at the NATO Space Center at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, in May.  Credit: U.S. Space Force\\nAvoid surprises \\nSpace Force’s competitive endurance strategy has three tenets: avoid operational surprise, deny first-mover advantage, and conduct responsible counter-space campaigns that don’t create long-lasting debris in orbit. \\n“If we get this right we will deter a crisis or conflict from extending into space,” Lt. Gen. DeAnna Burt, deputy chief of space operations, cyber and nuclear, said in an interview. \\n“But if needed, we will ensure space access for the joint force in a manner that maintains safety in the space domain for all responsible actors.” \\nAvoiding unwelcome surprises in space requires continuous awareness of what adversaries are doing in orbit, she said. \\nThe U.S. wants to prevent a Pearl Harbor-style attack in space, which is why the Space Force is turning more attention to space domain awareness, Burt said. “I have to be able to attribute any actions that are nefarious; I have to track and maintain custody of things I consider threats, and provide indications and warnings to other people.” \\nThe second tenet, denying first mover advantage in space, is where resilient architectures play a central role, she explained. \\n“If the enemy knows that attacking U.S. interests in space will require such a massive effort that it will become impractical or self-defeating, we will be deterring such actions in the first place,” she said. “It would be a case when the juice isn’t worth the squeeze.” \\nThe final tenet, conducting responsible counter-space campaigns, is about the idea that, if American assets were threatened, the U.S. would respond appropriately and would try to minimize the creation of debris in orbit. \\n“Polluting the domain is not what I want to do,” said Burt. There are ongoing discussions with allies about how operations could be conducted in a responsible manner, she said. \\nThe Space Force has been secretive about what technologies it might be developing to attack adversaries’ satellites without creating significant debris. \\n“General Saltzman has publicly talked about deliveries that will come in the 2026 timeframe,” Burt said. “And I think that’s when you’re going to see us start to figure out how we’re going to message that.” \\nAccess to space \\nChina and Russia have adopted strategies based on disabling adversaries’ space communications and navigation systems, said Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of U.S. Space Forces Indo-Pacific, a subordinate unit to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. \\nIt is stunning how fast China has modernized its space infrastructure to enable military capabilities like precision-guided missiles, Mastalir wrote in a June 14 article published by the Air University’s Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs. \\nBrig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of United States Space Forces, Indo-Pacific, speaks at a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command ceremony at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, Hawaii.  Credit: U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Anthony J. Rivera\\n“China has made unprecedented investments in its on-orbit capabilities over the past three years,” Mastalir noted. \\nThe U.S. military has been particularly wary of China’s secretive spaceplane — which has been described as a knockoff of the U.S. Air Force’s X-37B that can remain in orbit for years. China’s spaceplane has flown two long-endurance missions, and conducted proximity and capture maneuvers with a subsatellite, according to data from the commercial space-tracking firm LeoLabs.\\nMastalir pointed out that China deployed about 160 satellites in 2022, many of which will support military operations. By some estimates, China plans to launch 200 spacecraft in 2023. \\n“While many strategists are rightly concerned about China’s and Russia’s fielding of anti-satellite weapons designed to degrade or destroy U.S. satellites in space, it is important to note that much of China’s space investment enables its long-range precision strike capability,” he wrote. \\nSpace Force leaders also worry that a breakdown in U.S.-China communication and an underlying distrust that goes both ways could lead to miscalculations. \\nChina’s lack of transparency about its own space activities makes it difficult to reduce those risks, Burt warned in May at a space policy conference hosted by Arizona State University. \\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin cautioned June 1 that China’s reluctance to engage with U.S. defense leaders could result in “an incident that could very, very quickly spiral out of control.” \\nMore recently, Lt. Gen. John Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command, said the “biggest dynamic right now in our relationship with China with regard to space is a lack of communication and virtually zero transparency.” \\nThe absence of dialogue and interaction creates conditions for “miscommunication, misperception, misinterpretation, and then things could go wrong. And that can happen in any domain,” Shaw said June 14 at the Secure World Foundation’s Summit for Space Sustainability. \\nU.S. Space Command traffic watchers at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California issue warnings of close approaches in orbit or potential collision to satellite operations and national agencies, including the Chinese government. But when warnings are sent to Chinese email addresses, Shaw said, “We never get a response. Never.” \\n“Even the Russians know how to communicate with us,” Shaw said. “We don’t have anything like that with the Chinese and that’s the biggest hindrance to transparent operations.” \\n‘Gray zone’ competition \\nExperts agree that space powers are most likely to attack rival satellites in a conflict through “non kinetic” means. \\nStill, both China and Russia have demonstrated they can blow up satellites by striking them with kinetic weapons such as ground-based missiles. However, the United States needs to be more concerned about activities that fall below the threshold of an act of war but are damaging nonetheless, said Todd Harrison, aerospace industry analyst and managing director of Metrea Strategic Insights. \\nCyber and electronic jamming attacks are in the murky category of “gray zone” provocations that fall somewhere between low-intensity conflict and all-out war. \\nMilitary service members from the 4th Space Control Squadron stand in front of the Counter Communications System Block 10.2 at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.

A satellite that can’t see, think or communicate is as good as dead. “It’s probably going to be in the ground segment that you’ve got to be the most worried about, but it could be on the space side as well as there are now lasers that can blind sensors,” Harrison said. \\n“An adversary like China or others might think that they can get away with using that,” he said, “and could severely hamper our ability to sense and to communicate from space.” \\nThe U.S. military “historically has not really had a good response to gray zone activities” and that should concern the Space Force, said John Klein, a senior fellow and strategist at Falcon Research, and adjunct professor at George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute. \\n“We kind of let it happen with no repercussions,” Klein said. “It doesn’t have to be a military response. But the U.S. has to make it known it’s unacceptable behavior, and that there will be consequences.” \\nIt is notable, though, that the Space Force is openly talking about deterring China and about the importance of resilience in U.S. space networks, Klein said. \\nHe observed that space resilience is not a new concept, as the Pentagon for decades has studied the issue of how to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. satellites. \\n“What is new is that the U.S. Space Force more specifically recognizes resilience as part of deterrence. It’s deterrence by denial of benefits,” Klein said. “It’s telling enemies that no matter what you do, it’s not going to matter. You’re not going to stop me.” \\nU.S. still vulnerable \\nA move to more diversified constellations is necessary but might still not be enough to deter China, warned Charles Galbreath, senior fellow for space power studies at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Mitchell Institute. \\n“While the proliferated LEO approach garners a great deal of attention, it is not the only method the Space Force can employ to increase the resiliency of its architecture,” Galbreath, former deputy chief technology and innovation officer of the U.S. Space Force, said June 26 at a Mitchell Institute event. \\nIn a white paper titled “Building U.S. Space Force Counter-Space Capabilities,” Galbreath suggested the Space Force consider the “enduring military practice of deception to confuse adversaries and complicate their ability to target U.S. satellites.” \\nFor example, the U.S. could build satellite payloads or components in ways that would camouflage their functions. \\nThe Space Force also should expand its use of protection measures such as nuclear hardening and anti-jam systems, Galbreath said. \\nSpeaking June 12 at the Mitchell Institute, Thompson, the vice chief of space operations, recognized that deterrence may work in theory but not in practice. And if diplomacy and deterrence fail, the military has to prepare for the worstcase scenario. \\n“This is where we’ve spent a lot of time working with the other services,” said Thompson, to make sure they understand their dependence on space assets and figure out how to ensure the Army, Navy and Air Force can continue operating if U.S. satellites were targeted. \\nOther discussions on this subject are taking place with the private sector, as the Space Force tries to figure out contracting options to secure access to commercial space services during conflicts. \\nUnder an initiative known as Commercial Augmentation Space Reserves, the Space Force is looking at establishing agreements with companies to ensure that services like satellite communication and remote sensing are prioritized for U.S. government use during national security emergencies. \\nThe role of the private space sector in national security is significant, said Thompson. “When you think about proliferation and diversity, it’s not just the number of satellites, it’s also allies and commercial partners.” \\nNeed to keep space usable \\nEven if the U.S. has superior space technology, a vibrant private space sector and more powerful weaponry, the reality is that rival nations have the means today to destroy satellites and create “devastating impacts on the environment that will be harmful to the use of space for decades and perhaps centuries to come,” Thompson said. \\n“As we look at the proliferation of space capabilities, it will be increasingly difficult to deny some level of use of space to an adversary,” he added. \\nWhile preparing for a protracted competition with rival powers, said Thompson, the Space Force has to make sure the U.S. government has accurate intelligence so diplomats and military leaders know what’s happening in the space domain. \\n“If we’re operationally or strategically surprised, shame on us.”\\n\\nThis article originally appeared in the July 2023 issue of SpaceNews magazine.\\n'}\n",

He will assist the company, which announced plans in May to develop a single-module station called Haven-1 as a precursor for future, larger space stations.\\nReisman joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 1998 and spent three months on the International Space Station in 2008 as part of the Expedition 16 and 17 crews, and another 12 days on the STS-132 shuttle mission to the ISS in 2010. He retired from the astronaut corps in 2011 and worked for SpaceX for several years in various capacities, including director of space operations. He is currently a professor of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California.\\nIn an interview, Reisman said a former SpaceX colleague, now working at Vast, reached out to him with a technical question. That led to discussions with Vast executives about assisting the company. “I got excited by what I saw, which was a really interesting company doing some really cool work,” he said.\\nHe said he is particularly interested in the ability of Vast’s space stations to spin and create artificial gravity. “We have a lot of data at zero G and tons of data at one G about what it does to the human body. We have no idea what happens in between,” he said. Those stations, he said, could help answer questions such as how much partial gravity is needed to prevent some of the deleterious effects of microgravity on human physiology.\\nMax Haot, president of Vast, said the company was looking for someone intimately familiar with human spaceflight to assist its development of Haven-1. “The company had not yet gotten to the point where we had anyone with human spaceflight experience, who had gone to space,” he said. “I think it’s obvious to everyone that if you design a space station, you should have at least one, if not more, astronauts on board to help you with the process.”\\nReisman, he said, was an ideal fit because of both his NASA astronaut experience and work at SpaceX. Vast is working with SpaceX to launch Haven-1 and use Crew Dragon spacecraft to transport astronauts to the station.\\nReisman said he plans to focus on operations and safety. “I think those two things go hand-in-hand,” he said, to “make sure we hope for the best and plan for all possible outcomes.”\\nSince Vast announced Haven-1 in May, the company has signed an agreement with Impulse Space to use thrusters from that company on the spacecraft. It was also one of seven companies that won unfunded NASA Space Act Agreements to support work on commercial space capabilities.\\n“This is a great opportunity for us to build the relationship with NASA but also leverage a lot of their expertise,” Haot said of that agreement. It also includes “many technology milestones” to track its progress, he noted.\\nReisman, besides advising Vast, will continue as a senior adviser for SpaceX. He said that company had no issues with him also advising Vast since the two companies are working together.\\nHe also continues his teaching at USC, where he says he sees strong interest from students in careers in commercial human spaceflight. Some of his students have taken his class on human spaceflight out of a “vague interest” in the topic but have since gone on to pursue careers in the field.\\n“In a way I’m very jealous because it’s such a wonderful time to be working in this industry,” he said. “Coming as an engineer straight out of college there’s so many opportunities now that I didn’t have when I was finishing up my education.”\\n'}\n",

Thermal imagery startups were not.\\n“Much to our surprise, it was the only sensor area that didn’t have any companies that had really progressed,” said Seraphim Space CEO Mark Boggett. “None of the companies had raised $10 million, let alone $100 million or $500 million like some of the other sensor areas.”\\nAll that is changing. Startups focused on gathering thermal imagery via satellite are attracting investment, making acquisitions and winning contracts.\\n“It’s the next big thing in Earth observation,” said Anthony Baker, founder and CEO of Satellite Vu, a British Earth-observation startup. “No one has opened up the frontier on infrared.”\\nThe new businesses focused on thermal imagery vary widely. What the founders share is the conviction that startups can provide the type of data only expensive government satellites supplied in the past.\\nUrgent Climate Action\\nClimate change is propelling much of the work. Venture capital firms are flocking to startups promising to track emissions or mitigate the impact of droughts, floods and forest fires.\\n“There’s an urgency to do something,” said Max Gulde, CEO and co-founder of German startup constellr. “Having a thermal picture of our planet at an actionable resolution and frequency is something which is missing in our understanding of climate change. Suddenly, there’s a push for that.”\\nThermal imagery startups also are benefiting from recent declines in launch costs and technological advances.\\n“When I started founding the company, everyone was explaining to methat the sensor we wanted to build was impossible,” said Thomas Grübler, CEO and co-founder of Munich-based OroraTech. “Now, it’s possible to shrink these big complex systems to smallsat and cubesat scale.”\\nWhat’s more, founders have identified government and commercial customers willing to pay for thermal imagery. Farmers are buying data that help them irrigate crops without wasting water. And fire departments are eager for access to satellite images that reduce the need for dangerous aerial flights over wildfires.\\n“It’s getting cheaper to build a specialist constellation that can perform certain tasks extremely well,” Gulde said. “Suddenly, you’re passing a threshold where people are willing to pay.”\\nThe European Commission and the European Space Agency awarded contracts in June to constellr, OroraTech and Spanish startup Aistech Space.\\nThe companies will supply thermal data to complement observations collected through the European Union Copernicus Earth-observation program. \\nData Fusion\\nWhen Albedo, a Colorado startup, was founded in 2020, the business plan focused on collecting 10-centimeter-resolution optical imagery from telescopes in very low Earth orbit. The founders soon realized they could obtain longwave infrared imagery from the same satellites without much additional cost.\\n“With the optical resolution, we can go from counting cars to identifying cars,” said Albedo founder and CEO Topher Haddad. “With thermal, you can see where a car probably just pulled out from a parking spot.”\\nPlus, the combination of optical and thermal imagery helps observers distinguish hot tubs from pools or trampolines, and backyard dwelling units from sheds.\\nAlbedo has raised $58 million for refrigerator-size satellites scheduled to begin launching in 2025. \\nWork on Albedo’s infrared technology is being funded by the U.S. Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center under a $1.25 million contract. Under another $1.25 million contract, the Air Force is working with Albedo to look for ways to integrate Albedo imagery tasking with government systems.\\nConstellr’s celestr Land Surface Imaging product shows temperatures in Melbourne, Australia, an urban heat island. Credit: constellr Credit: constellr\\nEcosphere Health\\nConstellr is preparing to launch satellites in 2024 to gather thermal data for agricultural and environmental-monitoring applications.\\nSince the company was founded in 2020, constellr has raised about $14 million in venture capital and received an additional $14 million in grants. \\nEarlier this year, constellr acquired ScanWorld, a Belgian hyperspectral satellite imagery and analytics startup. With four shoebox-size satellites equipped with infrared sensors, constellr plans to gather daily imagery of agricultural fields around the world. By adding hyperspectral data, constellr can help farmers identify crop disease and manage fertilization schedules.\\nUnder the five-year, $5 million Copernicus contract announced in June, constellr will provide thermal imagery to thousands of European institutions.\\n“We’ve been working with the European Space Agency for quite some time,” Gulde said. “Government support has been exceptional.”\\nHydrosat, a startup building a constellation of thermal infrared imaging satellites, shows how its sensor highlights wildfire hot spots in contrast to visible imagery, which can be obscured by smoke. Credit: Hydrosat Credit: Hydrosat\\nWater Scarcity\\nWashington-based Hydrosat has raised $35.6 million to obtain thermal data from space. Supporting sustainable agriculture and helping customers reduce carbon emissions are the company’s primary goals.\\nThermal data can pick up initial signs of drought two to four weeks before optical imagery shows a change in the color of vegetation, said Pieter Fossel, Hydrosat CEO and co-founder.\\nIn June, Hydrosat acquired IrriWatch, a Netherlands company that delivers daily climate, crop, soil and irrigation updates to farmers.\\n“With IrriWatch, we can point to examples of how customers usingthis product, based on thermal satellite insights, are able to reduce water use,” Fossel said. “In a lot of parts of the world, reducing water use means less electricity for pumping that water out of the ground, less electricity for operating that mechanized center pivot irrigation system. And if the irrigation system is being run on diesel fuel, that’s a direct, measurable carbon reduction for the farm in addition to improvements in production, the boosting of yields and the reduction of water.”\\nHydrosat, founded in 2017, plans to launch its first two satellites next year to “deliver thermal infrared data as well as multispectral infrared data with higher resolution and greater revisit than what is available today,” Fossel said. “As a climate-oriented business, being able to have very tangible, measurable impacts is something that’s really important to us.”\\nOroraTech obtained thermal imagery of fires in Alberta, Canada, in June 2023. Credit: OroraTech Credit: OroraTech\\nFire Danger\\nAfter being told thermal imagery could not possibly be captured with cubesats, OroraTech’s founders raised $22.4 million to prove naysayers wrong. The German startup demonstrated its first uncooled thermalinfrared sensor on a Spire Global cubesat in 2022.\\n“People told me I wouldn’t see anything with this camera,” Grübler said. “We see fires at comparable quality to the Visible Infrared Imaging Sensor. We also see temperature quite well.”\\nOroraTech plans to collect global imagery every 30 minutes with a constellation of 96 satellites. The first eight satellites, built and operated by Spire Global under an agreement announced June 28, are slated to launch into a late-afternoon sun-synchronous orbit in 2024.\\n“We want to understand the trends in temperature, whether it’s for urban heat, industrial activity or forest fires,” Grübler said. “We want to be the first one to not only know where the forest fire is but the intensity of the forest fire and how it will behave.”\\nHigh-resolution image of the Satellite Vu Leeds test flight.

After raising 12.7 British pounds ($16 million) for satellites designed and manufactured with Surrey Satellite Technologies Ltd., SatVu launched its first spacecraft in June.\\nA second satellite is slated to launch in 2024. SatVu’s eight-satellite constellation should be operating in a couple of years, Baker said.\\nTo date, 66 companies have committed 128 million pounds to SatVu’s Early Access Programme. SatVu customers who sign up for the Early Access Programme can task SatVu’s airborne sensor to collect thermal imagery and obtain discounts on future satellite-tasking orders.\\nDefense and intelligence agencies may be SatVu’s first customers “because they already know what the data looks like,” Baker said. “They just don’t have a commercial data source they can share with allies.”\\nAnother potential application is industrial activity monitoring.\\n“With infrared, you can see activity in a building,” Baker said. “If it’s dormant, it probably has no heat signature. If it’s an active factory, you can see which parts of the factory are operating.”\\nFrom left to right: SuperSharp chief science officer Ian Parry, chief technology officer George Hawker, and CEO Marco Gomez-Jenkins, with Satlantis CEO Juan Tomas Hernani and business development manager Ignacio Mares. Credit: SuperSharp Credit: Satlantis\\nFoldable Telescopes\\nEarlier this year, Spain’s Satlantis acquired a majority stake in SuperSharp, a British university spin-out developing unfolding space telescopes to obtain thermal infrared imagery.\\nUK government agencies have provided initial funding for SuperSharp. \\nThe next milestone is to get to a space-rated version of our telescope, which we plan to do by the end of this year,” said Marco Gomez-Jenkins, SuperSharp co-founder and CEO. “After that, we’re focusing on testing our telescope in space by early 2025.”\\nSatlantis, meanwhile, sells a variety of Earth observation payloads and manufactures satellites like Armenia’s Armsat-1, launched in 2022. \\nOnce SuperSharp’s infrared telescope is flight-proven, the company will begin selling foldable telescopes for microwave-size cubesats and developing a larger version of the telescope for higher-resolution imagery.\\nGuardian Satellites\\nOne of the first startups to launch a thermal infrared imaging satellite was Aistech. The Spanish startup’s first cubesat equipped with a multi-spectral telescope to collect visible, near-infrared and thermal infraredimagery reached orbit in 2022.\\n“Temperature is a unique data source that is key to understanding activity on the Earth’s surface and the changes that can occur,” Aistech founder Carles Franquesa told SpaceNews by email. “And for this, Aistech’s strategic plan involves deploying its space infrastructure to monitor these changes continuously and accurately.”\\nAistech is preparing to launch 20 Guardian thermal-imagery satellites into a constellation, scheduled to be completed in 2027, with applications including water management, forestry, environmental monitoring and maritime security. Two additional Guardians are set to launch in the second quarter of 2024. \\nIn June, Aistech was named a Copernicus Contribution Mission contract.\\n“Becoming part of the select group of companies that provide data generated by their own constellation of satellites through the Copernicus Contributing Missions programme marks an important milestone for the company, since a reference client such as ESA validates that both the technology developed and the data generated by Aistech satellites will provide a new vision of the changes that occur on the Earth’s surface and a value to society facing new challenges on the planet,” Franquesa said. “ESA, through this program, is carrying out important work in promoting and developing new applications based on geospatial intelligence, which will allow a new generation of companies to provide new\\xa0solutions to specific problems; and this entails an exponential growth in the need for new satellite\\xa0data, and therefore a great development of the space thermal imaging market in the coming years.”\\nThis article originally appeared in the July 2023 issue of SpaceNews magazine.\\n'}\n",

Axiom’s task order begins work on a version of its suit for the ISS while Collins will begin design of a suit intended for moonwalks.\\nNASA awarded contracts to the two companies in June 2022 through its Exploration Extravehicular Activity Services program to support development of new Artemis and ISS spacesuits. NASA would then acquire spacesuit services rather than the suits themselves, effectively renting them versus owning them.\\nThe contracts, though, required the companies to compete for specific task orders for spacesuit development. NASA awarded one task order to Axiom Space in September 2022 to develop an Artemis spacesuit, valued at $228.5 million.

NASA said in a statement that, after completing initial design work, the agency will then consider exercising options for further suit development.\\nDoing so, the agency said, provides redundancy by having a backup suit for both the ISS and Artemis missions. “Using this competitive approach we will enhance redundancy, expand future capabilities, and further invest in the space economy,” said Lara Kearney, manager of the Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface Mobility Program at the Johnson Space Center.\\nThe awards may also more closely align with the companies’ plans. Axiom, which won the original task order for lunar spacesuits, is also developing a commercial space station that may require spacewalks either for maintenance or to serve customer requirements. Collins, which won the ISS suit task order last December, had earlier emphasized its work on lunar spacesuit designs.\\n“We are excited to add our orbital spacesuits as an option for NASA,” Mark Greeley, EVA program manager at Axiom Space, said in a company statement. The company said work on a low Earth orbit version of its spacesuit is already underway.\\n“Our next-generation spacesuit design is nearly 90% compatible with a lunar mission,” said Dave Romero, director of EVA and human space mobility systems at Collins, in a company statement. “This formal contract award will support continued efforts to modify our next-generation spacesuit, making it suitable to tasks on the moon.”\\nAxiom said that the full value of this new task order, if all options are exercised, is $142 million over four years.

We’ve got some really interesting causal autonomy tools that … allow the AI to be super smart about running into something that it hasn’t encountered before.”\\nAI also has important applications for remote-sensing data, said Aura Roy, Lockheed Martin deputy program manager for Multi-slit Solar Explorer mission, known as MUSE.\\nData gathered by hundreds or thousands of satellites traveling in different orbits could provide a “vast amount of information which would be beyond the ability of any number of human operators to parse through,” Roy said. “The goal is to use AI to determine truly optimal and trusted decisions from that raw data,” which may not be intuituve.\\nIn the future, “we will need to rely on a AI to augment human decision makers at all levels of command with advanced AI data processing and course-of-action generation that will support all types of operations,” Roy said.\\nQuantum Computing\\nIn addition, Lockheed Martin’s Space 2050 report focuses on quantum computing, quantum communications and quantum remote sensing, technologies.\\n“That computing infrastructure utilizing quantum will be there for us in the 2050 timeframe,” Lackner said. \\nAs a result, Lockheed Martin is developing “quantum algorithms to make use of quantum computers, quantum remote sensing and quantum communications,” Lackner said. “Specific space applications of quantum are going to be super enabling for what we want to do.”\\nNuclear Power, Crew Habitats and Mobility\\nAdvancements in power and propulsion, including nuclear technologies, “are going to be absolutely critical in terms of dramatically improving the types of missions that you can do and the types of science that you can collect,” said Kate Watts, Lockheed Martin’s vice president of Mission Strategy and Advanced Capabilities for Human and Scientific Exploration. “Think high-power generation, dramatically improved ISP related to propulsion, so you have more maneuverability” or the ability to reach distant locations more quickly.\\nBy 2050 more people will be traveling to low-Earth orbit as well as to the moon or Mars, which will create demand for habitats and vehicles to move around the lunar surface.\\n“When you’re on other worlds, you need to be able to move around, modify things, change the surface as needed,” Watts said. “You need to give the crew autonomy to manage science with machines that have capability like they do here on Earth.”\\nLunar Commercial Opportunities \\nBy 2050, “I think we’ll see regular commercial delivery services from the Earth to the moon and back for both cargo or people,” said Crescent Space CEO Joe Landon. Lockheed Martin established Crescent Space earlier this year to provide lunar communications and navigation services.\\nOn the lunar surface, crews will “be able to find, extract and process valuable resources to create fuel and to sustain life and support human operations,” Landon said.\\n“Every space mission today has to be completely self sufficient, has to bring everything you need with you and account for every contingency,” Landon said. “So, even the smallest missions or capabilities end up being very complex and costly.”\\nTo achieve Lockheed Martin’s Space 2050 vision, new infrastructure including computational capacity in cislunar space will be needed.\\nProviding access to lunar cloud computing would enable both governments and private actors to play a larger economic role in space. Instead of purchasing large assets and then having to maintain them, buyers would instead be able to buy capabilities as needed, Lackner said.\\nLockheed Martin selected 2050 as a goal for its technology report because that timeframe is long enough away “that we can truly develop disruptive technologies and disruptive capabilities,” said Nelson Pedreiro, vice president at Lockheed Martin’s Space Advanced Technology Center. \\xa0\\n'}\n",

In the case of space sustainability, as low Earth orbit fills with both active satellites and debris, the challenge is as much coming up with a solution to deal with that congestion as it is determining who should do it. \\nThe rapid growth in the number of space objects, caused by the rise of satellite constellations as well as debris-generating events like anti-satellite tests and collisions, is testing the international governance model for space activities developed in the early years of the Space Age that many in the industry believe can no longer keep up. \\n“More objects have been launched in the last 10 years than in the previous 50 combined,” — Guy Ryder, undersecretary-general for policy at the United Nations, speaking June 13, 2023 at the Secure World Foundation’s Summit for Space Sustainability. Credit: Marcel Crozet/ILO\\n“More objects have been launched in the last 10 years than in the previous 50 combined,” noted Guy Ryder, undersecretary-general for policy at the United Nations, during a speech at the Summit for Space Sustainability by the Secure World Foundation (SWF) in New York June 13. That creates, he said, “boundless development opportunities and governance needs.” \\nSpace governance has been handled at the international level by the U.N.’s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which now has 102 nations as members. In the 1960s, COPUOS helped guide the development of the Outer Space Treaty, the foundation of international space law, followed by several related agreements. \\nHowever, the large size of COPUOS and its use of a consensus-based model — all nations must agree — can make progress slow or nonexistent. Attendees of the most recent COPUOS meeting in Vienna, which concluded in early June, noted that one agenda item known as “dark and quiet skies” to study the effects of satellite constellations on astronomy had widespread support but was dropped because of objections from one nation, Iran, which is opposed to constellations in general on sovereignty grounds. \\n“It’s slow, it’s frustrating,” said Valda Vikmanis Keller, director of the U.S. State Department’s Office of Space Affairs, of COPUOS, during one panel at the Summit for Sustainability. But, she said, the discussions there were essential. “It’s the only way forward.” \\nHowever, some are looking for alternative mechanisms to address those growing space sustainability concerns. That includes efforts both within the United Nations itself and among other governments and organizations, seeking binding agreements or simply widely adopted norms and guidelines as the population of satellites and debris continues to grow. \\nWindow of opportunity \\nOne such effort is at the United Nations. It is beginning preparations for its Summit of the Future, a two-day meeting in New York in September 2024 where member nations will discuss key global issues. The U.N. calls it a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance.” \\nThe agenda of that meeting will include space. “We have a window of opportunity over the next 15 months,” Ryder said, “where we can accelerate space diplomacy and advance the governance issue.” \\nThe U.N. started planning for the Summit of the Future with the release of a policy paper in May on outer space governance. It highlighted as key topics space traffic coordination as well as space resource utilization and concerns about conflict in outer space. \\nThe report doesn’t offer specific solutions, but Ryder said the ultimate goal is to develop “one single united regime to facilitate data sharing, cooperation and continuity” in space traffic management and related issues. Those issues could be addressed individually, though, “if that path looks likelier to achieve results.” \\nCOPUOS will play a role in developing concepts to be considered at the Summit of the Future through its meetings next year, but it will not be the only mechanism. Portugal will host a conference in the spring of 2024 to develop proposals for consideration at the fall summit. \\nHugo André Costa, a member of the executive board of the Portuguese Space Agency, said at the SWF summit that the spring meeting will be preceded by two virtual workshops, one this October on technology issues and a second in March 2024 on policy issues. Those meetings will be open to representatives from industry, academia and governments. “This is the only way that we can prepare for the future,” he argued. \\nDeveloping a global space government framework in just 15 months is an ambitious task. If it is successful, though, Ryder suggested that the framework that emerges might look different from existing approaches. One model, he said, might be existing treaties like the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. “All of this provides us with the confidence that the kinds of agreements concluded in the past are possible in the future, even in today’s admittedly challenging geopolitical climate.” \\n“The notion is that we live in a rapidly changing world,” he said, looking for new approaches while maintaining existing mechanisms. “Let’s be honest: what worked yesterday will not necessarily work tomorrow. That is not a recipe or a reason to jettison everything that has worked up until this point.” \\n“But,” he added, “it can be a very strong reason to adapt, modify, improve what we have.” \\nPhone a friend \\nThe international community has demonstrated it can move quickly on space sustainability issues. After Russia conducted an ASAT demonstration in November 2021, destroying a defunct Russian satellite and creating thousands of pieces of debris, the United States and others started pushing for mechanisms to halt any future such tests. \\nU.S. officials said they didn’t expect Russia to perform a destructive direct-ascent (DA) ASAT test. “We were shocked. I’ll be honest with you, I was shocked,” said Audrey Schaffer, director of space policy at the National Security Council, during a talk at the Summit for Space Sustainability. “How could they do something so brazen, so reckless, and so clearly contrary to the safety, sustainability and security of an environment that so many of us depend upon?” \\nAt left, Lt. Gen. John Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command.  Credit: U.S. Space Command\\nLater at the summit, Lt. Gen. John Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command, said that the U.S. military suspected Russia was planning some sort of test. “They consider themselves the senior spacefaring nation,” he said, and thus expected Russia would do an “offset test” that fired a missile to deliberately miss the target. “They want to continue that tradition of being that senior, responsible spacefaring nation. I was wrong.” \\nThe Defense Department, he said, became “one of the earliest and biggest proponents” of what Vice President Kamala Harris announced the following April, that the U.S. would refrain from conducting similar ASAT tests and request other countries to do the same. \\nThat effort resulted in a U.N. General Assembly vote last December, just over a year after the Russian ASAT test, on a resolution regarding such a test ban. A total of 155 nations voted in favor of the resolution, while nine, including China and Russia, voted against it. Nine other nations, including India, abstained. \\n“That kind of vote count indicates a very strong base of support,” Schaffer said but argued it was not enough. The resolution, she noted, was non-binding, simply encouraging countries to make such commitments. As of June 2023, 13 countries have done so. \\n“To truly establish an internationally recognized norm banning destructive DAASAT missile testing, we need a critical mass of nations to actually make the commitment,” she said. \\nThat has been a slow process. Only three countries — Austria, Italy and the Netherlands — have formally committed not to conduct destructive ASAT tests since the U.N. vote. That slow progress, some suggested, may be due to domestic politics. \\nA photo exhibition called drawing attention to the fragility of Earth’s near-space environment was on display during last month’s meeting in Vienna of the U.N.’s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Credit: UNIS Vienna via Flickr\\n“We understand that other states that voted for the resolution but have not yet joined the commitment need some time to thoroughly review the domestic effects,” said Hyerin Kim, second secretary in the disarmament and non-proliferation division of South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. South Korea announced its commitment to refrain from such tests last October. “Korea is also making efforts to raise awareness of the danger posed by ASAT testing.” \\n“We had a great start out of the gate, but there’s more road ahead of us,” Schaffer said, urging conference attendees representing nations that had not made a commitment to consider doing so. And for those who have, “phone a friend and ask them to make the commitment too.” \\nAlternative approaches \\nOther efforts to address space sustainability are proliferating. At the Summit for Space Sustainability, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced a new set of guidelines for mitigating the growth of orbital debris. The document is the latest foray into space sustainability for the WEF, which previously led the development of a Space Sustainability Rating. \\nAmong the recommendations published by the WEF is to establish a success rate for “post-mission disposal,” or removal of satellites from orbit after the end of their missions, of 95% to 99%. That disposal, it added, should be done no later than five years after the end of a satellite’s life, versus earlier guidelines of 25 years. \\n“We wanted to push the envelope a little bit on some of these concrete, specific targets,” said Nikolai Khlystov, lead for the WEF’s Future of Space initiative, at the conference. The document also calls for satellites to be maneuverable, preferably through onboard propulsion, when operating at altitudes above 375 kilometers, and for operators to agree to share orbital data. \\nThe WEF convinced 27 companies to endorse the guidelines, including several major satellite operators. Notably absent, though, were some planning or deploying large constellations, such as Amazon and SpaceX. \\nKhlystov said the WEF worked with more than the 27 companies who signed the new guidelines. “If some actors didn’t sign on, I don’t think it’s a sign that they are against these standards,” he said. (An Amazon spokesperson later said that while the company helped craft those guidelines, it was not ready yet to endorse them as it assesses various other proposals.) \\nESA Director General Joseph Aschbacher, third from left, is shown discussing the Zero Debris charter during last month’s Paris Air Show with executives from Airbus Defence and Space, OHB SE and Thales Alenia Space. Credit: ESA\\nJust over a week later, the European Space Agency and three European satellite manufacturers — Airbus Defence and Space, OHB and Thales Alenia Space — announced their intent to develop a “Zero Debris Charter” to mitigate the growth of orbital debris. The charter, announced during the Paris Air Show, doesn’t exist yet beyond the most general outlines. \\n“The principle is a very simple one,” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said at the announcement. “The Zero Debris Charter is a principle where we would like to ensure that there is zero debris left behind in space.” He compared it a national park, where visitors are expected not to leave behind any garbage. \\nThe goal is that, under the charter, satellite operators would be expected by 2030 to either deorbit their satellites on their own at the end of their lives or hire a company that offers active debris removal services to do so. ESA and the companies plan to refine the details and complete the text of the charter by the end of the year. \\nWhat benefit the charter will have was not exactly clear at the announcement. All three companies participating have already endorsed the WEF’s guidelines, with some executives at the event praising that document for its specific requirements. \\nAschbacher suggested the charter could be incorporated into regulations so that governments agree to work only with those companies that agree to follow it. “We need to achieve a status where we demand that only data or information is bought from those satellite providers who are adhering to certain standards,” Aschbacher said. “The charter may be one vehicle for doing so.” \\nExecutives, though, were cautious about a solution to a worldwide problem that applied only to European companies. “It’s important that those regulations are worldwide,” said Hervé Derrey, chief executive of Thales Alenia Space. “If this is not applied to the rest of the world it will have no effect at the end. It will collectively fail. And, on top of that, European industry will not be on a level playing field with its competitors. That would be the worst situation.” \\n“Only with a real international regulation will we get it under control,” said Lutz Bertling, an OHB board member. \\nThat, then, returns to the United Nations and its often slow efforts. Ryder, at the Summit for Space Sustainability, was careful to praise COPUOS for its work even while suggesting changes are in order. “We have a very solid record of achievement,” he said. “It’s a very solid platform from which to start.” \\n“It’s very difficult to have 102 different ways of seeing the same thing,” Portugal’s Costa said, describing the long discussions at COPUOS meetings over things like wording of a single sentence in a statement all will accept. “You just need to have nerves of steel to wait until the very last moment when all the agreements are reached.” \\nAs low Earth orbit fills with satellites and debris, that very last moment for space sustainability may be rapidly approaching.\\n\\nThis article originally appeared in the July 2023 issue of SpaceNews magazine.\\n'}\n",

ESA announced in June that Marcus Wandt, a Swedish Air Force pilot selected by ESA as a reserve astronaut in November 2022, would go on that mission.\\nESA has not announced when Wandt will fly. Anna Rathsman, director general of the Swedish National Space Agency and outgoing chair of the ESA Council, said at the briefing that the flight had to be coordinated among the various organizations involved, including NASA.\\n“Sweden has been able to make very quickly decisions that allowed this flight to happen,” Aschbacher said. “In less than two months we have gone, I would say, from zero to signature of the agreements.”\\nWandt, he said, is already in Houston undergoing training for the flight. The earliest opportunity would be the Ax-3 mission, slated to fly to the ISS in late 2023 or early 2024. Axiom Space has not announced the crew for that mission.\\nOther European countries have expressed an interest in flying short-duration missions to the ISS. Walter Villadei, an Italian Air Force pilot who flew on Virgin Galactic’s first commercial suborbital flight June 29, also has trained with Axiom Space and was a backup on the Ax-2 mission to the station in May. Hungary’s foreign minister said at the ESA ministerial meeting in November 2022 that the country was spending $100 million on its own private astronaut to fly with Axiom.\\nThat activity comes as ESA is working on proposals for human spaceflight programs of its own. A report in March by an independent High-Level Advisory Group recommended ESA pursue the ability to launch its own astronauts, developing crewed spacecraft and potentially commercial space stations and lunar missions. In response, Aschbacher said in April that the agency was working on proposals to implement those recommendations.\\nIn a July 1 interview after the launch of ESA’s Euclid space telescope on a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, Aschbacher said the agency is continuing work on those proposals through the summer in preparation for a Space Summit of European nations in Seville, Spain, in November.\\nThose efforts included a discussion during a side meeting of last week’s ESA Council meeting. “The discussion was very constructive, very positive, and there’s a lot of work that is being done right now by our teams, with industry and with the member states to establish scenarios and options of what Europe could be doing and should be doing, and what the price tag is attached to it,” he said.\\nBy September or October, he expected to have “more clarity” on the various options, which he said currently are too premature to discuss publicly. He did note that one requirement is that the proposals not take funding from other ESA programs. “That’s why I’m calling for the Space Summit because this engages the top leaders in Europe to really discuss what Europe should be doing, because these decisions need to be made there.”\\nThe interest by several ESA member states in private astronaut missions is a positive sign for the agency’s plans for human space exploration, he argued. “Sweden, Poland and many others are now inspired by this ambition to go to space and have an astronaut flying into space,” he said. “This momentum starts developing, and I can only say it’s nice to see.”\\nAschbacher added that he didn’t think that such short-term missions, funded in Sweden’s case as part of a public-private partnership, would detract from efforts to craft a long-term human spaceflight program at the agency. “They have certainly raised the appetite and the attention, but you cannot compare a 10-day mission with a six-month mission on the space station,” he said. “But it’s a new element that we can add to our portfolio.”\\n'}\n",

The company’s first launch attempt in April saw the Tianlong-2 rocket make Space Pioneer the first Chinese commercial outfit to reach orbit with a liquid propellant launcher.\\nThe company has now raised a total of three billion Chinese yuan ($414 million) across 11 rounds since its establishment in 2018. In February the firm announced it had secured “B+” and “Pre-C” strategic funding rounds.\\nA number of the leading investors are linked to the Chinese state. These include China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a partially state-owned investment vehicle, CCB International, belonging to the China Construction Bank Corporation, and CITIC Construction, the engineering and construction arm of Chinese state-owned CITIC Group, and Zhejiang University Lianchuang. Venture capital also plays a part in the funding.\\nThe new funds will be used for the development of the Tianlong-3 kerosene-liquid oxygen launch vehicle and its engine and the construction of a dedicated launch complex at the Jiuquan national spaceport. The funds will also go towards developing mass production capabilities and recruitment.\\xa0\\nThe first launch of the Tianlong-3 rocket is currently scheduled for May 2024. It is intended to be somewhat comparable to the Falcon 9. If successful, Space Pioneer claims it will be able to launch 30 times per year from 2025.\\nTianlong-3 (“Sky Dragon-3”) is a two-stage kerosene-liquid oxygen rocket with a reusable first stage. Space Pioneer’s webpages state that the rocket will be capable of lifting 17 tons of payload to low Earth orbit, or 14 tons to 500-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit.\\xa0\\n\\xa0It will have a takeoff mass of 590 tons and produce 770 tons of thrust. The 71-meter-long Tianlong-3 will have a diameter of 3.8 meters. Previously, many commercial Chinese rockets used 2.25 or 3.35-meter-diameter stages, the dimensions as those of most Long March rockets.\\xa0\\nThe Tianlong-3 is, according to Space Pioneer, tailor-made for launching satellites for China’s national communications megaconstellation. Tianlong-3 will provide “important strategic support for the country’s new satellite Internet infrastructure,” according to the July 5 statement. The planned 13,000-strong Guowang constellation is seen as China’s answer to Starlink.\\nMore recently established Chinese commercial launch companies including Space Pioneer and OrienSpace are opting to develop much larger launch vehicles than earlier movers, which have committed to launchers with payload capacities on the order of a few thousand kilograms. This shift has been initiated by the emergence of the possibility of contracts for Guowang and commercial cargo missions.\\nSpace Pioneer says it has already signed 10 orders for launches on the Tianlong-2.\\nThe company also has plans for a Tianlong-3H, a triple-core version in the same style as the SpaceX Falcon Heavy, and the Tianlong-3M, a single core rocket tipped with a reusable spaceplane.\\nSpace Pioneer initially started out developing engines burning green monopropellant before changing direction. The firm also apparently scrapped development of the Tianlong-1 rocket.\\nThe firm has received sponsorship and investment from Zhangjiagang, a city in Jiangsu province on the Yangtze river. Space Pioneer is building rocket manufacturing facilities in the city and the Tianlong-2 launch also bore the name “Zhangjiagang.”\\nMeanwhile, fellow Chinese commercial firm Landspace is gearing up for the second launch of its Zhuque-2 methane-liquid oxygen rocket from Jiuquan.

The Ariane 5’s successor, Ariane 6, is still in development and appears increasingly unlikely to be ready for its inaugural launch before 2024. The Soyuz is no longer available in Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Vega C remains grounded after a December 2022 launch failure, and its return to flight, previously planned for late this year, is facing delays after an anomaly during a static-fire test June 28 of that rocket’s Zefiro 40 motor.\\nThe original version of the Vega, which does not use the Zefiro 40, is scheduled to resume launches in September, but most launches on the Vega manifest are of the more powerful Vega C. European startups such as Isar Aerospace and Rocket Factory Augsburg are working on small launch vehicles whose first flights could take place before the end of the year. But for larger payloads, there are few near-term options for European organizations.\\nThat situation led the European Space Agency to announce in October 2022 it was moving two missions to SpaceX’s Falcon 9. The first of those, the Euclid astronomy mission, was set to launch on Soyuz but instead lifted off on a Falcon 9 July 1 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Hera asteroid mission will launch on a Falcon 9 in October 2024 after being originally manifested on Ariane 6.\\nMore European missions are likely to fly on Falcon 9. At a June 29 briefing after a meeting of the ESA Council, the agency announced that the Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer, or EarthCARE, mission that has been moved from Soyuz to Vega C last October would instead likely fly on Falcon 9 in the second quarter of 2024.\\nWhile the announcement coincided with the news of the Zefiro 40 test anomaly, ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said the change was not directly linked to that but instead to the failed launch last December as well as changes in the size of EarthCARE that would have required modifications to the Vega C payload fairing to accommodate it.\\n“With these two elements, I asked my inspector general to reassess the situation,” he said at the briefing. “The conclusion of this assessment by the inspector general was recommending to me that we should not fly with Vega C.” That was based on the earlier Vega C failure review, which recommended no changes to the configuration, like the payload fairing, on the initial series of Vega C launches.\\nThe Falcon 9 payload fairing with the logos of ESA and the Euclid spacecraft. Credit: SpaceNews/Jeff Foust\\nAt the same briefing, ESA officials said they were also in discussions with SpaceX for the launch of up to four Galileo satellites on Falcon 9 vehicles. “We are moving ahead with negotiations to conclude hopefully soon with SpaceX,” said Javier Benedicto, ESA’s director of navigation. That is contingent on concluding the negotiations with SpaceX as well as securing approvals from the European Union and its security agreement with SpaceX.\\nIn a July 1 interview after the Euclid launch, Aschbacher said it will be up to the European Commission to decide when and how to launch those Galileo satellites. “We have provided all the technical information with regards to launcher compatibility, which the Commission has,” he said. “Now it’s up to them to make a decision.”\\nHe noted that Euclid was not the first time that ESA had used the Falcon 9. Sentinel-6A, also known as Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, was a joint U.S.-Europe Earth science mission launched on a Falcon 9 in November 2020. ESA astronauts have also flown on Crew Dragon missions. However, in those cases the launches were procured and overseen by NASA, not ESA.\\nAschbacher praised SpaceX for its role in launching Euclid. “SpaceX has been very proactive, very quick, very professional in providing this launch service. And I’m very happy now that this has been conducted successfully.”\\nHe reiterated past comments that the problems with Ariane 6 and Vega C and the loss of Soyuz had created a “launcher crisis” in Europe. “We are in a crisis and we should use the opportunity to convert this crisis into actions and changes that need to be adopted in order, in the future, to develop a robust launcher system for Europe,” he said, looking beyond Ariane 6 and Vega C.\\nHe also took the long view, expecting that this temporary gap in European launch capabilities will be forgotten in the long term, once Ariane 6 and Vega C are in regular operations. “Then this few months will be a blip,” he said. “Of course, now we are right in the midst of it and it’s difficult for everyone to accept the current situation. But you have to see this in the longer term.”\\n'}\n",

Gen. John Shaw said at a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies event.\\xa0\\nShaw specifically alluded to the military’s “neighborhood watch” satellites — known as GSSAP (Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program) — used to monitor the geostationary belt, where the Pentagon deploys its most valuable space assets.\\xa0\\nGSSAPs were built to last for decades but have a limited fuel supply, and maneuvers must be carefully planned to minimize fuel consumption.\\xa0\\nShaw has raised the issue at several public appearances in recent months. At the Mitchell forum, he once again insisted that the current approach of deploying satellites in designated orbits and minimizing maneuvers does not work in the age of great power competition.\\nHe said Space Command is advocating for a new approach he described as “dynamic space operations,” in contrast to the current practice of minimizing maneuvers for fear of depleting a satellite’s fuel supply.\\xa0\\n“This could be the most fundamental doctrinal shift that we’re probably going to see in the next four to five years,” he said.\\xa0\\nNeed maneuverable platforms\\nPerhaps not all satellites have to be highly maneuverable, Shaw said. But surveillance and reconnaissance platforms need to be more mobile in order to better monitor adversaries’ activities.\\xa0\\n“We launch a platform into orbit, and we tend to leave it right in that orbit,” Shaw said. “But we’re coming to the realization that that is not going to be sufficient anymore.”\\nShaw said he recently spent time with GSSAP operators at Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado. Their feedback reinforced the need for change in how these assets are developed and deployed, he added.\\n“GSSAP’s sole purpose is to move around the geosynchronous belt and to look at other platforms … And if there’s something that’s behaving suspiciously, we’ll look at that,” Shaw said.\\xa0\\nU.S. military satellites are operated to ensure they stay in service for many years or decades. “And so we are actually largely constrained by what we can do with those platforms,” he said. “I had a chance to sit down with operators a few weeks ago and spend a good amount of time understanding how they approach it.”\\nThey have to operate with significant constraints, said Shaw. “We can’t have those constraints in the future. And so we’re trying to articulate a requirement to the Space Force that we need to be able to have sustained space maneuver for those platforms.”\\nPotential solutions\\nIt will be up to the Space Force to come up with solutions to this problem, Shaw said. Among the options being considered is to build satellites with refueling ports so they can take advantage of commercial refueling services.\\xa0\\n“If I could refuel GSSAP satellites once a month, we would be operating them completely differently than we do now. They’d be operating at maximum trust levels and delta V levels that are unlike anything we’re doing right now,” Shaw said.\\nAnother possible solution is to rely on low-cost small satellites that would be replaced more frequently. “I’ll get another one in two weeks because I’m going to fly the heck out of it. And it’s going to empty that gas tank in a hurry.”\\nThe goal is to “achieve surprise and initiative against an adversary in ways that I can’t today,” Shaw added.\\xa0\\nThe Space Force is working to address these needs, he said.\\xa0\\n“We’ve asked for a demo by 2026 on how we would do sustained space maneuvers for a given platform.”\\n'}\n",

The launch had been scheduled for June 16 but was postponed a day in advance after Arianespace concluded that three pyrotechnical transmission lines used for the separation of the rocket’s solid rocket boosters needed to be replaced. The company rescheduled the launch for July 4, only to delay it an additional day because of strong upper-level winds.\\nAs with so many Ariane 5 missions, this launch, designated VA261, carried two communications satellites destined for geostationary transfer orbit. Nearly 30 minutes after liftoff, the rocket deployed Heinrich-Hertz-Satellit, a spacecraft built by OHB for the German Space Agency on behalf of other German government agencies. The 3,400-kilogram satellite will test advanced communications technologies.\\nAbout three and a half minutes later, the rocket deployed the other payload, the Syracuse 4B satellite for the French military. The 3,570-kilogram satellite was developed by a consortium of Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space, using an Airbus Eurostar 3000 bus.\\n“It is a success for ‘Team Europe’ tonight with this last and final Ariane 5,” Stéphane Israël, chief executive of Arianespace, said on the company’s webcast of the launch after confirmation of successful payload deployment.\\n“Thanks for ArianeGroup, Arianespace and CNES. It was a wonderful launch, even if it is the last one,” said Gen. Michel Sayegh, director of space programs for the French armaments agency DGA during the launch webcast.\\nThe launch was the 117th and final flight of the Ariane 5 over 27 years. The vehicle made its first, unsuccessful launch in June 1996, and suffered a partial failure on its second launch in October 1997 before an unqualified success on its third launch in October 1998. The rocket’s ability to carry two large geostationary communications satellites at once made it a key vehicle for many years in the commercial space industry during an era when geostationary communications satellites dominated the market.\\nThe European Space Agency also regularly used the rocket for several science missions as well as the launch of five Automated Transfer Vehicle cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station between 2008 and 2014. In perhaps the rocket’s highest-profile launch, it successfully launched the James Webb Space Telescope for NASA on Christmas Day 2021, delivering it on a trajectory so accurate it had the effect of significantly increasing the spacecraft’s lifetime by reducing the amount of propellant needed for trajectory correction maneuvers.\\n“Ariane 5 is now over, and Ariane 5 has perfectly finished its work and really is now a legendary launcher,” Israël said. “But Ariane 6 is coming.”\\nWaiting on Ariane 6\\nIn the lead up to the final Ariane 5 launch, Arianespace has advertised a “spaceflight continuum,” of past and future rockets, but that continuum is not necessarily continuous. The Ariane 5 overlapped with the end of the Ariane 4 rocket, which made its last launch in 2003. ESA had originally planned for a similar overlap between the end of the Ariane 5 and the introduction of its successor, the Ariane 6.\\nHowever, the development of Ariane 6 has been plagued by delays that have pushed out its first launch, once planned for 2020, by several years. In October 2022, ESA said it projected the first launch to take place in the fourth quarter of 2023, but it is increasingly likely the launch will slip into 2024.\\nExecutives with OHB, a supplier on the Ariane 6 program, said in an earnings call in May that they expected the first Ariane 6 launch to take place in early 2024, and no later than May 2024. “I am getting more and more confident we will see the first launch of Ariane 6 early next year,” Marco Fuchs, chief executive of OHB, said during the call.\\nESA and Arianespace have declined to provide an updated launch date for that inaugural mission. “Today it would be speculative to mention a launch date,” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said during a press briefing June 29 after an ESA Council meeting in Stockholm. “We have to go through a number of technical milestones over the summer period but I promise, after the summer in September, we will indicate a period which is the target period for the Ariane 6.”\\nThose milestones include a hot-fire test of the Ariane 6 upper stage scheduled for July at a test facility in Lampoldshausen, Germany, which will be followed by a second test in the fall to test its performance in what ESA calls “degraded cases.” Assembly of the first flight model of the Ariane 6 is planned to begin in November in French Guiana, according to an ESA update published June 8.\\n'}\n",

The emissions, at frequencies between 110 and 188 megahertz, are different from the deliberate transmissions from the satellites used to provide broadband internet access between 10.7 and 12.7 gigahertz.\\nUsing the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) radio telescope, astronomers detected emissions from 47 of 68 Starlink satellites they monitored. They detected several narrowband emissions at specific frequencies in that range, primarily from Starlink satellites in their operational orbits rather than those still in the process of raising their orbits after launch. They also detected broadband emissions over the entire range as well as one signal at 143.05 megahertz that was likely reflections from the French GRAVES space surveillance radar.\\nThe emissions, researchers said, likely come from electromagnetic interference from subsystems within the spacecraft. There are no international regulations regarding such emissions from spacecraft, in contrast to rules for terrestrial equipment.\\n“This study represents the latest effort to better understand satellite constellations’ impact on radio astronomy,” said Federico Di Vruno, co-director of the International Astronomical Union’s Center for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference and lead author of the study being published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Astronomers had theorized that such emissions could be detected, he noted in a statement. “Our observations confirm it is measurable.”\\nIt’s unclear what effect the electromagnetic interference emissions from Starlink satellites would have on radio astronomy, but astronomers noted that it spans one frequency range between 150.05 and 153 megahertz that is protected for radio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union.\\nThe emissions do not violate any regulations, and astronomers noted that SpaceX has been willing to talk about ways to mitigate any interference. That includes design changes already made to its next generation of Starlink satellites that can reduce those emissions.\\nHowever, astronomers said that similar emissions are likely from other satellite constellations, creating additional interference. “Our simulations show that the larger the constellation, the more important this effect becomes as the radiation from all satellites adds up,” said Benjamin Winkel of the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR), a co-author on the study, in a statement.\\n“This makes us not only worried about the existing constellations but even more about the planned ones, and also about the absence of clear regulation that protects the radio astronomy bands from unintended radiation,” he said.\\nAstronomers have raised concerns for several years about the potential deleterious impact of satellite constellations on astronomy. That has included both the deliberate radio transmissions from such satellites as well as reflected sunlight that can interfere with optical observations.\\nIn January, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), which funds several optical and radio astronomy observatories, announced a coordination agreement with SpaceX to mitigate the impacts of Starlink satellites on astronomy. That features efforts to reduce the brightness of Starlink satellites to least magnitude 7 as well as agreeing not to transmit while passing over major radio observatories.\\nDuring a town hall session at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society June 5, NSF officials said a similar coordination agreement had been reached with OneWeb, with more details to be released in the near future.\\nAstronomers involved in this study said they hope the detection of the electromagnetic interference emissions from the Starlink satellites will encourage other operators to take steps to mitigate similar emissions from their satellites.\\n“We believe that the early recognition of this situation gives astronomy and large constellation operators an opportunity to work together on technical mitigations pro-actively, in parallel to the necessary discussions to develop suitable regulations,” said Gyula Józsa of MPIfR and Rhodes University in South Africa.\\n'}\n",
            "Crawled:  {'date': datetime.date(2023, 7, 5), 'title': 'Regulatory uncertainty as commercial human spaceflight takes off', 'author': 'Jeff Foust', 'thumbnail': 'https://i0.wp.com/spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/galactic01-takeoff2.jpg?resize=800%2C600&ssl=1', 'text': 'WASHINGTON — As two companies prepare to begin or resume commercial suborbital human spaceflights, they are facing uncertainty about how the safety of the people on those flights will be regulated.\\nVirgin Galactic conducted its first commercial flight of its VSS Unity SpaceShipTwo vehicle June 29, flying three Italian payload specialists on a research mission designated Galactic 01. The company plans to begin monthly flights of private astronauts on that vehicle as soon as early August.\\nIt joins Blue Origin, which started flying paying customers on its New Shepard suborbital vehicle in 2021. New Shepard has been grounded after an engine problem on a September 2022 payload-only flight, although Bob Smith, chief executive of Blue Origin, said at a June 6 conference that the company would be ready to resume flights “within the next few weeks.” The company has not provided any further updates on flight plans.\\nBoth companies operate under a regulatory regime by the Federal Aviation Administration that focuses on the safety of the uninvolved public. Federal law sharply restricts the FAA’s ability to enact regulations for the safety of spaceflight participants on commercial vehicles. This restriction, called a “moratorium” by some in the field and a “learning period” by others, limits the FAA’s ability to enact such regulations to accidents that caused death or injury, or had the potential to cause death or injury.\\nThat restriction was included in the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 and, at the time, was to last eight years, giving industry time to build up flight experience upon which regulations could be based. It has been extended several times and is now currently set to expire at the end of September.\\nMany in industry have been lobbying for another extension, arguing that companies are only now beginning to fly vehicles on a routine basis, allowing them to develop that experience the restriction was designed to foster.\\n“The issue of the learning period is, should the government be limited to only regulate if there is evidence requiring regulation or should they be allowed to regulate prospectively without data, without any specific reason to regulate?” said Jim Muncy of PoliSpace during a panel discussion on the topic by the Beyond Earth Institute in May.\\nA report by the RAND Corporation in April, though, recommended that the current restrictions be allowed to expire this year. It concluded that doing so would allow the FAA and industry to move forward on developing regulations in gradual, coordinated process.\\n“It doesn’t mean we’re recommending a large stockpile of regulations immediately. In fact, it’s just the opposite,” said Bruce McClintock, senior policy researcher at RAND, during the Beyond Earth webinar. “We would broadly call this expanding the learning period to include more tools and resources.”\\nIt’s unclear if the current restriction can be extended. The House and Senate have been working on their versions of reauthorization legislation for the FAA, but neither currently includes any language about the learning period. The House Science Committee is working on a separate commercial space bill that could address the issue. However, any bill faces long odds of passage before Oct. 1.\\n“We have a divided Congress, so the ability to move an extension through may be a bit challenging this year,” said Caryn Schenewerk, president of CS Consulting who previously worked on regulatory issues for Relativity Space and SpaceX, during the webinar. Failure to achieve an extension, she said, may be less of an active decision by Congress than a side effect of broader debates between the Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate.\\nShould the restriction expire on Oct. 1, FAA officials have said they do not have a set of regulations ready to be enacted, but are looking at ways of cooperating with industry to shorten the development time for spaceflight participant safety rules.\\nMike Moses, president of spaceline missions and safety at Virgin Galactic, said in an interview after the Galactic 01 flight he has been encouraged about discussions his company, along with Blue Origin and SpaceX, have had with the FAA on how regulations could be developed.\\n“The idea would be to take the data we’ve learned and use that to craft very specific, focused development areas,” he said, emphasizing the need for performance-based regulations given the different technical approaches those three companies are taking for human spaceflight. “One set of regulations just won’t apply to all.”\\nHe also played down any impact on the industry, or the debate on regulations, from the June 18 accident of a commercial deep-sea submersible, Titan, built and operated by OceanGate. That accident, which killed the five people on board, raised scrutiny about the level of regulation of that industry and parallels with commercial spaceflight, given both are forms of adventure tourism with similar clientele; one of the people killed on Titan, Hamish Harding, flew on Blue Origin’s New Shepard in 2022.\\nMoses said any comparison of that accident with commercial spaceflight is an “apples-to-oranges” one given that there is existing regulation of commercial spacecraft to protect the uninvolved public. “It certainly drives accountability. You’re not totally unsupervised,” he said. “It’s a very different thing in comparison to OceanGate.”\\n'}\n",

The spacecraft will gradually go from a geostationary transfer orbit to a low lunar orbit, from which Chandrayaan-3 will descend to the lunar surface.\\nChandrayaan-3 is similar to India’s first lunar lander flown as part of the Chandrayaan-2 mission, which crashed attempting a soft landing in September 2019. Chandrayaan-3 incorporates several revisions, such as additional fuel, based on the investigation into the failed landing.\\nThat crash took place five months after Beresheet, a spacecraft originally developed by Israeli non-profit organization SpaceIL to compete for the Google Lunar X Prize, crashed attempting its own lunar landing. SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries, which built the spacecraft, later said the lander crashed because one of its inertial measurement units malfunctioned.\\nSpaceIL announced its intent to pursue a second mission, called Beresheet 2. It would be significantly different from the original mission, with two smaller landers deployed from an orbiter. The mission had been slated to launch in 2025, a date confirmed in a January 2023 announcement of a joint statement of intent between the Israel Space Agency and NASA to cooperate on Beresheet 2. NASA agreed to provide an instrument and communications support for the mission.\\nThat schedule, and the mission itself, is now in question. Like the first mission, SpaceIL projected using philanthropic donations to fund Beresheet 2. However, in May a group of donors announced they were halting future payments to the project after spending $45 million, nearly half its estimated $100 million cost.\\nIn a statement representing the donors, Morris Kahn, a billionaire who also supported the original Beresheet mission, said the decision to halt future payments was not related to any problems with Beresheet 2. “These times obligate us to invest our resources and time in other philanthropic projects,” he stated.\\nSpaceIL said at the time it would seek alternative funding to continue the mission, but has provided no updates on those efforts since then. The organization did not respond to questions July 10 about the status of Beresheet 2.\\nIn a June 27 presentation at the European Lunar Symposium, Dan Blumberg, chairman of the Israel Space Agency, said work on Beresheet 2 was continuing for now. “We want to do more than we did in the previous one,” he said, including enhanced opportunities for international cooperation. In addition to the NASA agreement, SpaceIL has an agreement with the German agency DLR, which will provide a navigation system for the lander.\\nHe also emphasized educational outreach for the mission. Students will have opportunities to control the orbiter during its two-year mission, selecting regions on the surface to photograph, he said.\\nBlumberg hinted at SpaceIL’s financial problems in his brief talk, but did not go into details about funding for the mission. “There is a funding issue that we are still dealing with,” he said. “But we’re getting there.”\\n'}\n",

This was later verified by U.S. Space Force space tracking data, showing an object in a 431 by 461-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination of\\xa097.3 degrees.\\nThe Zhuque-2 mission carried no payload and the rocket’s first stage was not recovered. An unconfirmed number of payloads were lost in the launcher’s first flight in December 2022.\\xa0\\nZhuque-2 beats a range of other methalox rockets, including SpaceX’s Starship, the ULA Vulcan, Blue Origin’s New Glenn, Rocket Lab’s Neutron and Terran R from Relativity Space, in reaching orbit. These other launch vehicles will be much larger and feature much greater payload capacity.\\nA methane-liquid oxygen propellant mix offers advantages in performance and reduces issues of soot formation and coking for purposes of reusability.\\nThe successful launch also makes Landspace the second private Chinese launch firm to reach orbit with a liquid propellant rocket. This follows the success of Space Pioneer with its Tianlong-2 rocket in April this year.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/CNSAWatcher/status/1679006943698976768\\n\\nTaken together, the achievements indicate a breakthrough and growing level of maturity in Chinese commercial space launch efforts.\\nLandspace has already begun assembling its third Zhuque-2 (“Vermillion Bird-2”), indicating that another launch could come before the end of the year. Space Pioneer says it has multiple orders for launches for the Tianlong-2, and aims to launch the Falcon 9-class Tianlong-3 in the first half of 2024.\\nLandspace CEO Zhang Changwu told Chinese language Global Times tabloid that the company could now begin mass-producing the Zhuque-2, having finalized and verified its design.\\nLandspace’s Zhuque-2 is powered by gas generator engines producing 268 tons of thrust. Future Zhuque-2 launches with upgraded second stage engines will be capable of delivering a 6,000-kilogram payload capacity to a 200-kilometer low Earth orbit (LEO), or 4,000 kilograms to 500-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), according to Landspace.\\nThe rocket has a diameter of 3.35 meters—the same as a number of national Long March rockets—and a take-off mass of 219 tons.\\xa0\\nThe rocket is currently expendable but Landspace is working on a restartable version of the 80-ton-thrust TQ-12 engine which powers the Zhuque-2 first stage.\\xa0\\n\\nView from above:https://t.co/2pY1F2mgFW pic.twitter.com/GDAj7uWqS7— Cosmic Penguin (@Cosmic_Penguin) July 12, 2023\\n\\nLandspace is one of China’s first commercial rocket firms. It was established in 2015, soon after the Chinese government opened up parts of the space sector to private capital in late 2014, which is seen to be a reaction to developments in the U.S.\\xa0\\nIt is also one of the best-funded Chinese launch firms, but the company’s journey to orbit has not been smooth. Its first launch, which took place in October 2018, used the smaller and simpler solid-propellant Zhuque-1. The mission ended in failure, and the company announced it would not repeat the attempt and instead focus on its methane-fueled Zhuque-2.\\nThe company has however built up infrastructure during this time. Landspace has set up an intelligent manufacturing base in Huzhou, Zhejiang Province and established a $1.5 billion medium and large-scale liquid rocket assembly and test plant at Jiaxing, also in Zhejiang.\\nThe company is now in a position to secure contracts for the Zhuque-2 but faces a field of competition. Other Chinese firms, including iSpace, Galactic Energy and Deep Blue Aerospace, are working on their own, reusable liquid propellant rockets.\\nSpace Pioneer and other later movers such as OrienSpace are developing larger rockets which are targeting contracts to launch batches of satellites for China’s national satellite internet megaconstellation project, named Guowang.\\nChina recently opened a call for space station commercial cargo proposals, further indicating that commercial firms will have a growing role to play in the country’s space sector.\\nThe Zhuque-2 launch was China’s 27th orbital mission of 2023, with a total of more than 70 launches planned from state-owned main space contractor CASC and commercial players. Landspace, Space Pioneer, Galactic Energy, iSpace and Expace have so far complemented national launches this year.\\n'}\n",

As evidence, the term surpasses 300 mentions in the Space Force’s 2024 budget documents. \\n“It’s amazing how many times you see the word resiliency in the budget justification materials,” said analyst Sam Wilson of the Aerospace Corporation’s Center for Space Policy and Strategy. \\nThe emphasis on resilience — or adaptability in the face of attacks — reflects the priorities set by the new chief of space operations Gen. Chance Saltzman. The running theme in the budget is the need to ensure U.S. access to space and shore up capabilities to compete with space powers like China and Russia. \\n“China, our pacing challenge, is the most immediate threat in, to, and from space for which the Space Force must maintain technological advantage,” Saltzman said in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year. \\n“Russia, while less capable, remains an acute threat that is developing asymmetric counter-space systems meant to neutralize American satellites,” said Saltzman. \\n‘Competitive endurance’ \\nA push for resilience is part of a multifaceted strategy Saltzman rolled out in March called “competitive endurance” to guide Space Force plans to deter and combat adversaries. \\nVice Chief of Space Operations Gen. David “DT” Thompson said the Space Force’s central responsibility is ensuring U.S. military forces and allies have access to satellite services. \\nAnd that is why resilience is so critical, he said June 15 at the Defense One Tech Summit. \\n“Ukraine showed that proliferation works. It leads to resilient architectures,” Thompson said, referring to Russia’s repelled attempts to jam SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellite service used by Ukrainian forces. \\nThe U.S. armed forces and allies today rely on a secure space infrastructure — for communications, early warnings of ballistic missile attacks and other services — that the Space Force provides from a relatively small number of geostationary satellites in harder to reach orbits. “And we have to continue to understand how to defend and protect those against counter-space attacks,” he said. \\n“I think that’s probably the biggest concern right now,” Thompson said, “ensuring we have enough resilience in both proliferated constellations, and those small numbers of larger systems to be able to defend them.”\\nA shift to proliferated constellations is already under way. \\nThe Space Development Agency — a procurement organization under the Space Force — is moving forward with a multibillion dollar plan to field a mesh network of satellites in low Earth orbit for missile warning and for data transport. The agency in April launched its first batch of 10 satellites and announced plans to launch its next 13 spacecraft in late July. \\nProliferation and redundancy make the loss of a few satellites tolerable, said Thompson, and bolster deterrence because targeting them imposes increased cost on an adversary. \\nThis is how the Space Force plans to deal with China’s threats in the long term, he said. “We are in a long competition with China. They absolutely believe that.” \\n“We can’t look at a finish line in this competition,” Thompson added. “We have to think what we need to do to compete for the next 10 to 50 years.” \\nLt. Gen. DeAnna Burt, chief operations officer of the U.S. Space Force, is briefed on NATO space operations at the NATO Space Center at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, in May.  Credit: U.S. Space Force\\nAvoid surprises \\nSpace Force’s competitive endurance strategy has three tenets: avoid operational surprise, deny first-mover advantage, and conduct responsible counter-space campaigns that don’t create long-lasting debris in orbit. \\n“If we get this right we will deter a crisis or conflict from extending into space,” Lt. Gen. DeAnna Burt, deputy chief of space operations, cyber and nuclear, said in an interview. \\n“But if needed, we will ensure space access for the joint force in a manner that maintains safety in the space domain for all responsible actors.” \\nAvoiding unwelcome surprises in space requires continuous awareness of what adversaries are doing in orbit, she said. \\nThe U.S. wants to prevent a Pearl Harbor-style attack in space, which is why the Space Force is turning more attention to space domain awareness, Burt said. “I have to be able to attribute any actions that are nefarious; I have to track and maintain custody of things I consider threats, and provide indications and warnings to other people.” \\nThe second tenet, denying first mover advantage in space, is where resilient architectures play a central role, she explained. \\n“If the enemy knows that attacking U.S. interests in space will require such a massive effort that it will become impractical or self-defeating, we will be deterring such actions in the first place,” she said. “It would be a case when the juice isn’t worth the squeeze.” \\nThe final tenet, conducting responsible counter-space campaigns, is about the idea that, if American assets were threatened, the U.S. would respond appropriately and would try to minimize the creation of debris in orbit. \\n“Polluting the domain is not what I want to do,” said Burt. There are ongoing discussions with allies about how operations could be conducted in a responsible manner, she said. \\nThe Space Force has been secretive about what technologies it might be developing to attack adversaries’ satellites without creating significant debris. \\n“General Saltzman has publicly talked about deliveries that will come in the 2026 timeframe,” Burt said. “And I think that’s when you’re going to see us start to figure out how we’re going to message that.” \\nAccess to space \\nChina and Russia have adopted strategies based on disabling adversaries’ space communications and navigation systems, said Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of U.S. Space Forces Indo-Pacific, a subordinate unit to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. \\nIt is stunning how fast China has modernized its space infrastructure to enable military capabilities like precision-guided missiles, Mastalir wrote in a June 14 article published by the Air University’s Journal of Indo-Pacific Affairs. \\nBrig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of United States Space Forces, Indo-Pacific, speaks at a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command ceremony at Joint Base Pearl Harbor–Hickam, Hawaii.  Credit: U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Anthony J. Rivera\\n“China has made unprecedented investments in its on-orbit capabilities over the past three years,” Mastalir noted. \\nThe U.S. military has been particularly wary of China’s secretive spaceplane — which has been described as a knockoff of the U.S. Air Force’s X-37B that can remain in orbit for years. China’s spaceplane has flown two long-endurance missions, and conducted proximity and capture maneuvers with a subsatellite, according to data from the commercial space-tracking firm LeoLabs.\\nMastalir pointed out that China deployed about 160 satellites in 2022, many of which will support military operations. By some estimates, China plans to launch 200 spacecraft in 2023. \\n“While many strategists are rightly concerned about China’s and Russia’s fielding of anti-satellite weapons designed to degrade or destroy U.S. satellites in space, it is important to note that much of China’s space investment enables its long-range precision strike capability,” he wrote. \\nSpace Force leaders also worry that a breakdown in U.S.-China communication and an underlying distrust that goes both ways could lead to miscalculations. \\nChina’s lack of transparency about its own space activities makes it difficult to reduce those risks, Burt warned in May at a space policy conference hosted by Arizona State University. \\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin cautioned June 1 that China’s reluctance to engage with U.S. defense leaders could result in “an incident that could very, very quickly spiral out of control.” \\nMore recently, Lt. Gen. John Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command, said the “biggest dynamic right now in our relationship with China with regard to space is a lack of communication and virtually zero transparency.” \\nThe absence of dialogue and interaction creates conditions for “miscommunication, misperception, misinterpretation, and then things could go wrong. And that can happen in any domain,” Shaw said June 14 at the Secure World Foundation’s Summit for Space Sustainability. \\nU.S. Space Command traffic watchers at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California issue warnings of close approaches in orbit or potential collision to satellite operations and national agencies, including the Chinese government. But when warnings are sent to Chinese email addresses, Shaw said, “We never get a response. Never.” \\n“Even the Russians know how to communicate with us,” Shaw said. “We don’t have anything like that with the Chinese and that’s the biggest hindrance to transparent operations.” \\n‘Gray zone’ competition \\nExperts agree that space powers are most likely to attack rival satellites in a conflict through “non kinetic” means. \\nStill, both China and Russia have demonstrated they can blow up satellites by striking them with kinetic weapons such as ground-based missiles. However, the United States needs to be more concerned about activities that fall below the threshold of an act of war but are damaging nonetheless, said Todd Harrison, aerospace industry analyst and managing director of Metrea Strategic Insights. \\nCyber and electronic jamming attacks are in the murky category of “gray zone” provocations that fall somewhere between low-intensity conflict and all-out war. \\nMilitary service members from the 4th Space Control Squadron stand in front of the Counter Communications System Block 10.2 at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.

A satellite that can’t see, think or communicate is as good as dead. “It’s probably going to be in the ground segment that you’ve got to be the most worried about, but it could be on the space side as well as there are now lasers that can blind sensors,” Harrison said. \\n“An adversary like China or others might think that they can get away with using that,” he said, “and could severely hamper our ability to sense and to communicate from space.” \\nThe U.S. military “historically has not really had a good response to gray zone activities” and that should concern the Space Force, said John Klein, a senior fellow and strategist at Falcon Research, and adjunct professor at George Washington University’s Space Policy Institute. \\n“We kind of let it happen with no repercussions,” Klein said. “It doesn’t have to be a military response. But the U.S. has to make it known it’s unacceptable behavior, and that there will be consequences.” \\nIt is notable, though, that the Space Force is openly talking about deterring China and about the importance of resilience in U.S. space networks, Klein said. \\nHe observed that space resilience is not a new concept, as the Pentagon for decades has studied the issue of how to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. satellites. \\n“What is new is that the U.S. Space Force more specifically recognizes resilience as part of deterrence. It’s deterrence by denial of benefits,” Klein said. “It’s telling enemies that no matter what you do, it’s not going to matter. You’re not going to stop me.” \\nU.S. still vulnerable \\nA move to more diversified constellations is necessary but might still not be enough to deter China, warned Charles Galbreath, senior fellow for space power studies at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Mitchell Institute. \\n“While the proliferated LEO approach garners a great deal of attention, it is not the only method the Space Force can employ to increase the resiliency of its architecture,” Galbreath, former deputy chief technology and innovation officer of the U.S. Space Force, said June 26 at a Mitchell Institute event. \\nIn a white paper titled “Building U.S. Space Force Counter-Space Capabilities,” Galbreath suggested the Space Force consider the “enduring military practice of deception to confuse adversaries and complicate their ability to target U.S. satellites.” \\nFor example, the U.S. could build satellite payloads or components in ways that would camouflage their functions. \\nThe Space Force also should expand its use of protection measures such as nuclear hardening and anti-jam systems, Galbreath said. \\nSpeaking June 12 at the Mitchell Institute, Thompson, the vice chief of space operations, recognized that deterrence may work in theory but not in practice. And if diplomacy and deterrence fail, the military has to prepare for the worstcase scenario. \\n“This is where we’ve spent a lot of time working with the other services,” said Thompson, to make sure they understand their dependence on space assets and figure out how to ensure the Army, Navy and Air Force can continue operating if U.S. satellites were targeted. \\nOther discussions on this subject are taking place with the private sector, as the Space Force tries to figure out contracting options to secure access to commercial space services during conflicts. \\nUnder an initiative known as Commercial Augmentation Space Reserves, the Space Force is looking at establishing agreements with companies to ensure that services like satellite communication and remote sensing are prioritized for U.S. government use during national security emergencies. \\nThe role of the private space sector in national security is significant, said Thompson. “When you think about proliferation and diversity, it’s not just the number of satellites, it’s also allies and commercial partners.” \\nNeed to keep space usable \\nEven if the U.S. has superior space technology, a vibrant private space sector and more powerful weaponry, the reality is that rival nations have the means today to destroy satellites and create “devastating impacts on the environment that will be harmful to the use of space for decades and perhaps centuries to come,” Thompson said. \\n“As we look at the proliferation of space capabilities, it will be increasingly difficult to deny some level of use of space to an adversary,” he added. \\nWhile preparing for a protracted competition with rival powers, said Thompson, the Space Force has to make sure the U.S. government has accurate intelligence so diplomats and military leaders know what’s happening in the space domain. \\n“If we’re operationally or strategically surprised, shame on us.”\\n\\nThis article originally appeared in the July 2023 issue of SpaceNews magazine.\\n'}\n",

He will assist the company, which announced plans in May to develop a single-module station called Haven-1 as a precursor for future, larger space stations.\\nReisman joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 1998 and spent three months on the International Space Station in 2008 as part of the Expedition 16 and 17 crews, and another 12 days on the STS-132 shuttle mission to the ISS in 2010. He retired from the astronaut corps in 2011 and worked for SpaceX for several years in various capacities, including director of space operations. He is currently a professor of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California.\\nIn an interview, Reisman said a former SpaceX colleague, now working at Vast, reached out to him with a technical question. That led to discussions with Vast executives about assisting the company. “I got excited by what I saw, which was a really interesting company doing some really cool work,” he said.\\nHe said he is particularly interested in the ability of Vast’s space stations to spin and create artificial gravity. “We have a lot of data at zero G and tons of data at one G about what it does to the human body. We have no idea what happens in between,” he said. Those stations, he said, could help answer questions such as how much partial gravity is needed to prevent some of the deleterious effects of microgravity on human physiology.\\nMax Haot, president of Vast, said the company was looking for someone intimately familiar with human spaceflight to assist its development of Haven-1. “The company had not yet gotten to the point where we had anyone with human spaceflight experience, who had gone to space,” he said. “I think it’s obvious to everyone that if you design a space station, you should have at least one, if not more, astronauts on board to help you with the process.”\\nReisman, he said, was an ideal fit because of both his NASA astronaut experience and work at SpaceX. Vast is working with SpaceX to launch Haven-1 and use Crew Dragon spacecraft to transport astronauts to the station.\\nReisman said he plans to focus on operations and safety. “I think those two things go hand-in-hand,” he said, to “make sure we hope for the best and plan for all possible outcomes.”\\nSince Vast announced Haven-1 in May, the company has signed an agreement with Impulse Space to use thrusters from that company on the spacecraft. It was also one of seven companies that won unfunded NASA Space Act Agreements to support work on commercial space capabilities.\\n“This is a great opportunity for us to build the relationship with NASA but also leverage a lot of their expertise,” Haot said of that agreement. It also includes “many technology milestones” to track its progress, he noted.\\nReisman, besides advising Vast, will continue as a senior adviser for SpaceX. He said that company had no issues with him also advising Vast since the two companies are working together.\\nHe also continues his teaching at USC, where he says he sees strong interest from students in careers in commercial human spaceflight. Some of his students have taken his class on human spaceflight out of a “vague interest” in the topic but have since gone on to pursue careers in the field.\\n“In a way I’m very jealous because it’s such a wonderful time to be working in this industry,” he said. “Coming as an engineer straight out of college there’s so many opportunities now that I didn’t have when I was finishing up my education.”\\n'}\n",

Thermal imagery startups were not.\\n“Much to our surprise, it was the only sensor area that didn’t have any companies that had really progressed,” said Seraphim Space CEO Mark Boggett. “None of the companies had raised $10 million, let alone $100 million or $500 million like some of the other sensor areas.”\\nAll that is changing. Startups focused on gathering thermal imagery via satellite are attracting investment, making acquisitions and winning contracts.\\n“It’s the next big thing in Earth observation,” said Anthony Baker, founder and CEO of Satellite Vu, a British Earth-observation startup. “No one has opened up the frontier on infrared.”\\nThe new businesses focused on thermal imagery vary widely. What the founders share is the conviction that startups can provide the type of data only expensive government satellites supplied in the past.\\nUrgent Climate Action\\nClimate change is propelling much of the work. Venture capital firms are flocking to startups promising to track emissions or mitigate the impact of droughts, floods and forest fires.\\n“There’s an urgency to do something,” said Max Gulde, CEO and co-founder of German startup constellr. “Having a thermal picture of our planet at an actionable resolution and frequency is something which is missing in our understanding of climate change. Suddenly, there’s a push for that.”\\nThermal imagery startups also are benefiting from recent declines in launch costs and technological advances.\\n“When I started founding the company, everyone was explaining to methat the sensor we wanted to build was impossible,” said Thomas Grübler, CEO and co-founder of Munich-based OroraTech. “Now, it’s possible to shrink these big complex systems to smallsat and cubesat scale.”\\nWhat’s more, founders have identified government and commercial customers willing to pay for thermal imagery. Farmers are buying data that help them irrigate crops without wasting water. And fire departments are eager for access to satellite images that reduce the need for dangerous aerial flights over wildfires.\\n“It’s getting cheaper to build a specialist constellation that can perform certain tasks extremely well,” Gulde said. “Suddenly, you’re passing a threshold where people are willing to pay.”\\nThe European Commission and the European Space Agency awarded contracts in June to constellr, OroraTech and Spanish startup Aistech Space.\\nThe companies will supply thermal data to complement observations collected through the European Union Copernicus Earth-observation program. \\nData Fusion\\nWhen Albedo, a Colorado startup, was founded in 2020, the business plan focused on collecting 10-centimeter-resolution optical imagery from telescopes in very low Earth orbit. The founders soon realized they could obtain longwave infrared imagery from the same satellites without much additional cost.\\n“With the optical resolution, we can go from counting cars to identifying cars,” said Albedo founder and CEO Topher Haddad. “With thermal, you can see where a car probably just pulled out from a parking spot.”\\nPlus, the combination of optical and thermal imagery helps observers distinguish hot tubs from pools or trampolines, and backyard dwelling units from sheds.\\nAlbedo has raised $58 million for refrigerator-size satellites scheduled to begin launching in 2025. \\nWork on Albedo’s infrared technology is being funded by the U.S. Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center under a $1.25 million contract. Under another $1.25 million contract, the Air Force is working with Albedo to look for ways to integrate Albedo imagery tasking with government systems.\\nConstellr’s celestr Land Surface Imaging product shows temperatures in Melbourne, Australia, an urban heat island.

With four shoebox-size satellites equipped with infrared sensors, constellr plans to gather daily imagery of agricultural fields around the world. By adding hyperspectral data, constellr can help farmers identify crop disease and manage fertilization schedules.\\nUnder the five-year, $5 million Copernicus contract announced in June, constellr will provide thermal imagery to thousands of European institutions.\\n“We’ve been working with the European Space Agency for quite some time,” Gulde said. “Government support has been exceptional.”\\nHydrosat, a startup building a constellation of thermal infrared imaging satellites, shows how its sensor highlights wildfire hot spots in contrast to visible imagery, which can be obscured by smoke. Credit: Hydrosat Credit: Hydrosat\\nWater Scarcity\\nWashington-based Hydrosat has raised $35.6 million to obtain thermal data from space. Supporting sustainable agriculture and helping customers reduce carbon emissions are the company’s primary goals.\\nThermal data can pick up initial signs of drought two to four weeks before optical imagery shows a change in the color of vegetation, said Pieter Fossel, Hydrosat CEO and co-founder.\\nIn June, Hydrosat acquired IrriWatch, a Netherlands company that delivers daily climate, crop, soil and irrigation updates to farmers.\\n“With IrriWatch, we can point to examples of how customers usingthis product, based on thermal satellite insights, are able to reduce water use,” Fossel said. “In a lot of parts of the world, reducing water use means less electricity for pumping that water out of the ground, less electricity for operating that mechanized center pivot irrigation system. And if the irrigation system is being run on diesel fuel, that’s a direct, measurable carbon reduction for the farm in addition to improvements in production, the boosting of yields and the reduction of water.”\\nHydrosat, founded in 2017, plans to launch its first two satellites next year to “deliver thermal infrared data as well as multispectral infrared data with higher resolution and greater revisit than what is available today,” Fossel said. “As a climate-oriented business, being able to have very tangible, measurable impacts is something that’s really important to us.”\\nOroraTech obtained thermal imagery of fires in Alberta, Canada, in June 2023. Credit: OroraTech Credit: OroraTech\\nFire Danger\\nAfter being told thermal imagery could not possibly be captured with cubesats, OroraTech’s founders raised $22.4 million to prove naysayers wrong. The German startup demonstrated its first uncooled thermalinfrared sensor on a Spire Global cubesat in 2022.\\n“People told me I wouldn’t see anything with this camera,” Grübler said. “We see fires at comparable quality to the Visible Infrared Imaging Sensor. We also see temperature quite well.”\\nOroraTech plans to collect global imagery every 30 minutes with a constellation of 96 satellites. The first eight satellites, built and operated by Spire Global under an agreement announced June 28, are slated to launch into a late-afternoon sun-synchronous orbit in 2024.\\n“We want to understand the trends in temperature, whether it’s for urban heat, industrial activity or forest fires,” Grübler said. “We want to be the first one to not only know where the forest fire is but the intensity of the forest fire and how it will behave.”\\nHigh-resolution image of the Satellite Vu Leeds test flight.

After raising 12.7 British pounds ($16 million) for satellites designed and manufactured with Surrey Satellite Technologies Ltd., SatVu launched its first spacecraft in June.\\nA second satellite is slated to launch in 2024. SatVu’s eight-satellite constellation should be operating in a couple of years, Baker said.\\nTo date, 66 companies have committed 128 million pounds to SatVu’s Early Access Programme. SatVu customers who sign up for the Early Access Programme can task SatVu’s airborne sensor to collect thermal imagery and obtain discounts on future satellite-tasking orders.\\nDefense and intelligence agencies may be SatVu’s first customers “because they already know what the data looks like,” Baker said. “They just don’t have a commercial data source they can share with allies.”\\nAnother potential application is industrial activity monitoring.\\n“With infrared, you can see activity in a building,” Baker said. “If it’s dormant, it probably has no heat signature. If it’s an active factory, you can see which parts of the factory are operating.”\\nFrom left to right: SuperSharp chief science officer Ian Parry, chief technology officer George Hawker, and CEO Marco Gomez-Jenkins, with Satlantis CEO Juan Tomas Hernani and business development manager Ignacio Mares.

The Spanish startup’s first cubesat equipped with a multi-spectral telescope to collect visible, near-infrared and thermal infraredimagery reached orbit in 2022.\\n“Temperature is a unique data source that is key to understanding activity on the Earth’s surface and the changes that can occur,” Aistech founder Carles Franquesa told SpaceNews by email. “And for this, Aistech’s strategic plan involves deploying its space infrastructure to monitor these changes continuously and accurately.”\\nAistech is preparing to launch 20 Guardian thermal-imagery satellites into a constellation, scheduled to be completed in 2027, with applications including water management, forestry, environmental monitoring and maritime security. Two additional Guardians are set to launch in the second quarter of 2024. \\nIn June, Aistech was named a Copernicus Contribution Mission contract.\\n“Becoming part of the select group of companies that provide data generated by their own constellation of satellites through the Copernicus Contributing Missions programme marks an important milestone for the company, since a reference client such as ESA validates that both the technology developed and the data generated by Aistech satellites will provide a new vision of the changes that occur on the Earth’s surface and a value to society facing new challenges on the planet,” Franquesa said. “ESA, through this program, is carrying out important work in promoting and developing new applications based on geospatial intelligence, which will allow a new generation of companies to provide new\\xa0solutions to specific problems; and this entails an exponential growth in the need for new satellite\\xa0data, and therefore a great development of the space thermal imaging market in the coming years.”\\nThis article originally appeared in the July 2023 issue of SpaceNews magazine.\\n'}\n",

Axiom’s task order begins work on a version of its suit for the ISS while Collins will begin design of a suit intended for moonwalks.\\nNASA awarded contracts to the two companies in June 2022 through its Exploration Extravehicular Activity Services program to support development of new Artemis and ISS spacesuits. NASA would then acquire spacesuit services rather than the suits themselves, effectively renting them versus owning them.\\nThe contracts, though, required the companies to compete for specific task orders for spacesuit development. NASA awarded one task order to Axiom Space in September 2022 to develop an Artemis spacesuit, valued at $228.5 million. It awarded another to Collins Aerospace in December 2022 for an ISS spacesuit, valued at $97.2 million.\\nThe companies will use the new “crossover” task orders to adapt the suits they are developing for one application to the other. NASA said in a statement that, after completing initial design work, the agency will then consider exercising options for further suit development.\\nDoing so, the agency said, provides redundancy by having a backup suit for both the ISS and Artemis missions. “Using this competitive approach we will enhance redundancy, expand future capabilities, and further invest in the space economy,” said Lara Kearney, manager of the Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface Mobility Program at the Johnson Space Center.\\nThe awards may also more closely align with the companies’ plans. Axiom, which won the original task order for lunar spacesuits, is also developing a commercial space station that may require spacewalks either for maintenance or to serve customer requirements. Collins, which won the ISS suit task order last December, had earlier emphasized its work on lunar spacesuit designs.\\n“We are excited to add our orbital spacesuits as an option for NASA,” Mark Greeley, EVA program manager at Axiom Space, said in a company statement. The company said work on a low Earth orbit version of its spacesuit is already underway.\\n“Our next-generation spacesuit design is nearly 90% compatible with a lunar mission,” said Dave Romero, director of EVA and human space mobility systems at Collins, in a company statement. “This formal contract award will support continued efforts to modify our next-generation spacesuit, making it suitable to tasks on the moon.”\\nAxiom said that the full value of this new task order, if all options are exercised, is $142 million over four years.

The company was considering at the time both debt and equity options to raise additional cash to keep the company operating as it continues work on Rocket 4, which the company does not anticipate entering commercial service until some time in 2024.\\nAstra also faced a potential delisting of its stock from the Nasdaq because its price had fallen below $1 per share. Astra was originally given 180 days by Nasdaq, starting in October 2022, to get its share price above $1 for at least 10 consecutive business days. The company won a 180-day extension on April 10.\\nAstra said July 10 that its board had approved a plan for a 1-for-15 reverse stock split that will occur no later than Oct. 2. Under that plan, 15 shares of existing Astra stock will be exchanged for one new share of Astra stock. That will have the effect of boosting the share price but not the company’s overall market cap. Shareholders had approved a proposal at the company’s annual shareholder meeting June 8 to allow the board to enact a reverse split of between 1-for-5 and 1-for-15.\\nShares in Astra closed July 10 at 40.2 cents per share, which would be $6.03 after the reverse split. Those shares have fallen more than 97% in value from their peak in early July 2021, shortly after Astra completed its merger with Holicity, a special-purpose acquisition company, and started trading publicly on Nasdaq.\\n'}\n",

We’ve got some really interesting causal autonomy tools that … allow the AI to be super smart about running into something that it hasn’t encountered before.”\\nAI also has important applications for remote-sensing data, said Aura Roy, Lockheed Martin deputy program manager for Multi-slit Solar Explorer mission, known as MUSE.\\nData gathered by hundreds or thousands of satellites traveling in different orbits could provide a “vast amount of information which would be beyond the ability of any number of human operators to parse through,” Roy said. “The goal is to use AI to determine truly optimal and trusted decisions from that raw data,” which may not be intuituve.\\nIn the future, “we will need to rely on a AI to augment human decision makers at all levels of command with advanced AI data processing and course-of-action generation that will support all types of operations,” Roy said.\\nQuantum Computing\\nIn addition, Lockheed Martin’s Space 2050 report focuses on quantum computing, quantum communications and quantum remote sensing, technologies.\\n“That computing infrastructure utilizing quantum will be there for us in the 2050 timeframe,” Lackner said. \\nAs a result, Lockheed Martin is developing “quantum algorithms to make use of quantum computers, quantum remote sensing and quantum communications,” Lackner said. “Specific space applications of quantum are going to be super enabling for what we want to do.”\\nNuclear Power, Crew Habitats and Mobility\\nAdvancements in power and propulsion, including nuclear technologies, “are going to be absolutely critical in terms of dramatically improving the types of missions that you can do and the types of science that you can collect,” said Kate Watts, Lockheed Martin’s vice president of Mission Strategy and Advanced Capabilities for Human and Scientific Exploration. “Think high-power generation, dramatically improved ISP related to propulsion, so you have more maneuverability” or the ability to reach distant locations more quickly.\\nBy 2050 more people will be traveling to low-Earth orbit as well as to the moon or Mars, which will create demand for habitats and vehicles to move around the lunar surface.\\n“When you’re on other worlds, you need to be able to move around, modify things, change the surface as needed,” Watts said. “You need to give the crew autonomy to manage science with machines that have capability like they do here on Earth.”\\nLunar Commercial Opportunities \\nBy 2050, “I think we’ll see regular commercial delivery services from the Earth to the moon and back for both cargo or people,” said Crescent Space CEO Joe Landon. Lockheed Martin established Crescent Space earlier this year to provide lunar communications and navigation services.\\nOn the lunar surface, crews will “be able to find, extract and process valuable resources to create fuel and to sustain life and support human operations,” Landon said.\\n“Every space mission today has to be completely self sufficient, has to bring everything you need with you and account for every contingency,” Landon said. “So, even the smallest missions or capabilities end up being very complex and costly.”\\nTo achieve Lockheed Martin’s Space 2050 vision, new infrastructure including computational capacity in cislunar space will be needed.\\nProviding access to lunar cloud computing would enable both governments and private actors to play a larger economic role in space. Instead of purchasing large assets and then having to maintain them, buyers would instead be able to buy capabilities as needed, Lackner said.\\nLockheed Martin selected 2050 as a goal for its technology report because that timeframe is long enough away “that we can truly develop disruptive technologies and disruptive capabilities,” said Nelson Pedreiro, vice president at Lockheed Martin’s Space Advanced Technology Center. \\xa0\\n'}\n",

In the case of space sustainability, as low Earth orbit fills with both active satellites and debris, the challenge is as much coming up with a solution to deal with that congestion as it is determining who should do it. \\nThe rapid growth in the number of space objects, caused by the rise of satellite constellations as well as debris-generating events like anti-satellite tests and collisions, is testing the international governance model for space activities developed in the early years of the Space Age that many in the industry believe can no longer keep up. \\n“More objects have been launched in the last 10 years than in the previous 50 combined,” — Guy Ryder, undersecretary-general for policy at the United Nations, speaking June 13, 2023 at the Secure World Foundation’s Summit for Space Sustainability. Credit: Marcel Crozet/ILO\\n“More objects have been launched in the last 10 years than in the previous 50 combined,” noted Guy Ryder, undersecretary-general for policy at the United Nations, during a speech at the Summit for Space Sustainability by the Secure World Foundation (SWF) in New York June 13. That creates, he said, “boundless development opportunities and governance needs.” \\nSpace governance has been handled at the international level by the U.N.’s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which now has 102 nations as members. In the 1960s, COPUOS helped guide the development of the Outer Space Treaty, the foundation of international space law, followed by several related agreements. \\nHowever, the large size of COPUOS and its use of a consensus-based model — all nations must agree — can make progress slow or nonexistent. Attendees of the most recent COPUOS meeting in Vienna, which concluded in early June, noted that one agenda item known as “dark and quiet skies” to study the effects of satellite constellations on astronomy had widespread support but was dropped because of objections from one nation, Iran, which is opposed to constellations in general on sovereignty grounds. \\n“It’s slow, it’s frustrating,” said Valda Vikmanis Keller, director of the U.S. State Department’s Office of Space Affairs, of COPUOS, during one panel at the Summit for Sustainability. But, she said, the discussions there were essential. “It’s the only way forward.” \\nHowever, some are looking for alternative mechanisms to address those growing space sustainability concerns. That includes efforts both within the United Nations itself and among other governments and organizations, seeking binding agreements or simply widely adopted norms and guidelines as the population of satellites and debris continues to grow. \\nWindow of opportunity \\nOne such effort is at the United Nations. It is beginning preparations for its Summit of the Future, a two-day meeting in New York in September 2024 where member nations will discuss key global issues. The U.N. calls it a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance.” \\nThe agenda of that meeting will include space. “We have a window of opportunity over the next 15 months,” Ryder said, “where we can accelerate space diplomacy and advance the governance issue.” \\nThe U.N. started planning for the Summit of the Future with the release of a policy paper in May on outer space governance. It highlighted as key topics space traffic coordination as well as space resource utilization and concerns about conflict in outer space. \\nThe report doesn’t offer specific solutions, but Ryder said the ultimate goal is to develop “one single united regime to facilitate data sharing, cooperation and continuity” in space traffic management and related issues. Those issues could be addressed individually, though, “if that path looks likelier to achieve results.” \\nCOPUOS will play a role in developing concepts to be considered at the Summit of the Future through its meetings next year, but it will not be the only mechanism. Portugal will host a conference in the spring of 2024 to develop proposals for consideration at the fall summit. \\nHugo André Costa, a member of the executive board of the Portuguese Space Agency, said at the SWF summit that the spring meeting will be preceded by two virtual workshops, one this October on technology issues and a second in March 2024 on policy issues. Those meetings will be open to representatives from industry, academia and governments. “This is the only way that we can prepare for the future,” he argued. \\nDeveloping a global space government framework in just 15 months is an ambitious task. If it is successful, though, Ryder suggested that the framework that emerges might look different from existing approaches. One model, he said, might be existing treaties like the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea. “All of this provides us with the confidence that the kinds of agreements concluded in the past are possible in the future, even in today’s admittedly challenging geopolitical climate.” \\n“The notion is that we live in a rapidly changing world,” he said, looking for new approaches while maintaining existing mechanisms. “Let’s be honest: what worked yesterday will not necessarily work tomorrow. That is not a recipe or a reason to jettison everything that has worked up until this point.” \\n“But,” he added, “it can be a very strong reason to adapt, modify, improve what we have.” \\nPhone a friend \\nThe international community has demonstrated it can move quickly on space sustainability issues. After Russia conducted an ASAT demonstration in November 2021, destroying a defunct Russian satellite and creating thousands of pieces of debris, the United States and others started pushing for mechanisms to halt any future such tests. \\nU.S. officials said they didn’t expect Russia to perform a destructive direct-ascent (DA) ASAT test. “We were shocked. I’ll be honest with you, I was shocked,” said Audrey Schaffer, director of space policy at the National Security Council, during a talk at the Summit for Space Sustainability. “How could they do something so brazen, so reckless, and so clearly contrary to the safety, sustainability and security of an environment that so many of us depend upon?” \\nAt left, Lt. Gen. John Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command.  Credit: U.S. Space Command\\nLater at the summit, Lt. Gen. John Shaw, deputy commander of U.S. Space Command, said that the U.S. military suspected Russia was planning some sort of test. “They consider themselves the senior spacefaring nation,” he said, and thus expected Russia would do an “offset test” that fired a missile to deliberately miss the target. “They want to continue that tradition of being that senior, responsible spacefaring nation. I was wrong.” \\nThe Defense Department, he said, became “one of the earliest and biggest proponents” of what Vice President Kamala Harris announced the following April, that the U.S. would refrain from conducting similar ASAT tests and request other countries to do the same. \\nThat effort resulted in a U.N. General Assembly vote last December, just over a year after the Russian ASAT test, on a resolution regarding such a test ban. A total of 155 nations voted in favor of the resolution, while nine, including China and Russia, voted against it. Nine other nations, including India, abstained. \\n“That kind of vote count indicates a very strong base of support,” Schaffer said but argued it was not enough. The resolution, she noted, was non-binding, simply encouraging countries to make such commitments. As of June 2023, 13 countries have done so. \\n“To truly establish an internationally recognized norm banning destructive DAASAT missile testing, we need a critical mass of nations to actually make the commitment,” she said. \\nThat has been a slow process. Only three countries — Austria, Italy and the Netherlands — have formally committed not to conduct destructive ASAT tests since the U.N. vote. That slow progress, some suggested, may be due to domestic politics. \\nA photo exhibition called drawing attention to the fragility of Earth’s near-space environment was on display during last month’s meeting in Vienna of the U.N.’s Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. Credit: UNIS Vienna via Flickr\\n“We understand that other states that voted for the resolution but have not yet joined the commitment need some time to thoroughly review the domestic effects,” said Hyerin Kim, second secretary in the disarmament and non-proliferation division of South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. South Korea announced its commitment to refrain from such tests last October. “Korea is also making efforts to raise awareness of the danger posed by ASAT testing.” \\n“We had a great start out of the gate, but there’s more road ahead of us,” Schaffer said, urging conference attendees representing nations that had not made a commitment to consider doing so. And for those who have, “phone a friend and ask them to make the commitment too.” \\nAlternative approaches \\nOther efforts to address space sustainability are proliferating. At the Summit for Space Sustainability, the World Economic Forum (WEF) announced a new set of guidelines for mitigating the growth of orbital debris. The document is the latest foray into space sustainability for the WEF, which previously led the development of a Space Sustainability Rating. \\nAmong the recommendations published by the WEF is to establish a success rate for “post-mission disposal,” or removal of satellites from orbit after the end of their missions, of 95% to 99%. That disposal, it added, should be done no later than five years after the end of a satellite’s life, versus earlier guidelines of 25 years. \\n“We wanted to push the envelope a little bit on some of these concrete, specific targets,” said Nikolai Khlystov, lead for the WEF’s Future of Space initiative, at the conference. The document also calls for satellites to be maneuverable, preferably through onboard propulsion, when operating at altitudes above 375 kilometers, and for operators to agree to share orbital data. \\nThe WEF convinced 27 companies to endorse the guidelines, including several major satellite operators. Notably absent, though, were some planning or deploying large constellations, such as Amazon and SpaceX. \\nKhlystov said the WEF worked with more than the 27 companies who signed the new guidelines. “If some actors didn’t sign on, I don’t think it’s a sign that they are against these standards,” he said. (An Amazon spokesperson later said that while the company helped craft those guidelines, it was not ready yet to endorse them as it assesses various other proposals.) \\nESA Director General Joseph Aschbacher, third from left, is shown discussing the Zero Debris charter during last month’s Paris Air Show with executives from Airbus Defence and Space, OHB SE and Thales Alenia Space. Credit: ESA\\nJust over a week later, the European Space Agency and three European satellite manufacturers — Airbus Defence and Space, OHB and Thales Alenia Space — announced their intent to develop a “Zero Debris Charter” to mitigate the growth of orbital debris. The charter, announced during the Paris Air Show, doesn’t exist yet beyond the most general outlines. \\n“The principle is a very simple one,” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said at the announcement. “The Zero Debris Charter is a principle where we would like to ensure that there is zero debris left behind in space.” He compared it a national park, where visitors are expected not to leave behind any garbage. \\nThe goal is that, under the charter, satellite operators would be expected by 2030 to either deorbit their satellites on their own at the end of their lives or hire a company that offers active debris removal services to do so. ESA and the companies plan to refine the details and complete the text of the charter by the end of the year. \\nWhat benefit the charter will have was not exactly clear at the announcement. All three companies participating have already endorsed the WEF’s guidelines, with some executives at the event praising that document for its specific requirements. \\nAschbacher suggested the charter could be incorporated into regulations so that governments agree to work only with those companies that agree to follow it. “We need to achieve a status where we demand that only data or information is bought from those satellite providers who are adhering to certain standards,” Aschbacher said. “The charter may be one vehicle for doing so.” \\nExecutives, though, were cautious about a solution to a worldwide problem that applied only to European companies. “It’s important that those regulations are worldwide,” said Hervé Derrey, chief executive of Thales Alenia Space. “If this is not applied to the rest of the world it will have no effect at the end. It will collectively fail. And, on top of that, European industry will not be on a level playing field with its competitors. That would be the worst situation.” \\n“Only with a real international regulation will we get it under control,” said Lutz Bertling, an OHB board member. \\nThat, then, returns to the United Nations and its often slow efforts. Ryder, at the Summit for Space Sustainability, was careful to praise COPUOS for its work even while suggesting changes are in order. “We have a very solid record of achievement,” he said. “It’s a very solid platform from which to start.” \\n“It’s very difficult to have 102 different ways of seeing the same thing,” Portugal’s Costa said, describing the long discussions at COPUOS meetings over things like wording of a single sentence in a statement all will accept. “You just need to have nerves of steel to wait until the very last moment when all the agreements are reached.” \\nAs low Earth orbit fills with satellites and debris, that very last moment for space sustainability may be rapidly approaching.\\n\\nThis article originally appeared in the July 2023 issue of SpaceNews magazine.\\n'}\n",

ESA announced in June that Marcus Wandt, a Swedish Air Force pilot selected by ESA as a reserve astronaut in November 2022, would go on that mission.\\nESA has not announced when Wandt will fly. Anna Rathsman, director general of the Swedish National Space Agency and outgoing chair of the ESA Council, said at the briefing that the flight had to be coordinated among the various organizations involved, including NASA.\\n“Sweden has been able to make very quickly decisions that allowed this flight to happen,” Aschbacher said. “In less than two months we have gone, I would say, from zero to signature of the agreements.”\\nWandt, he said, is already in Houston undergoing training for the flight. The earliest opportunity would be the Ax-3 mission, slated to fly to the ISS in late 2023 or early 2024.

Walter Villadei, an Italian Air Force pilot who flew on Virgin Galactic’s first commercial suborbital flight June 29, also has trained with Axiom Space and was a backup on the Ax-2 mission to the station in May. Hungary’s foreign minister said at the ESA ministerial meeting in November 2022 that the country was spending $100 million on its own private astronaut to fly with Axiom.\\nThat activity comes as ESA is working on proposals for human spaceflight programs of its own. A report in March by an independent High-Level Advisory Group recommended ESA pursue the ability to launch its own astronauts, developing crewed spacecraft and potentially commercial space stations and lunar missions. In response, Aschbacher said in April that the agency was working on proposals to implement those recommendations.\\nIn a July 1 interview after the launch of ESA’s Euclid space telescope on a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, Aschbacher said the agency is continuing work on those proposals through the summer in preparation for a Space Summit of European nations in Seville, Spain, in November.\\nThose efforts included a discussion during a side meeting of last week’s ESA Council meeting. “The discussion was very constructive, very positive, and there’s a lot of work that is being done right now by our teams, with industry and with the member states to establish scenarios and options of what Europe could be doing and should be doing, and what the price tag is attached to it,” he said.\\nBy September or October, he expected to have “more clarity” on the various options, which he said currently are too premature to discuss publicly. He did note that one requirement is that the proposals not take funding from other ESA programs. “That’s why I’m calling for the Space Summit because this engages the top leaders in Europe to really discuss what Europe should be doing, because these decisions need to be made there.”\\nThe interest by several ESA member states in private astronaut missions is a positive sign for the agency’s plans for human space exploration, he argued. “Sweden, Poland and many others are now inspired by this ambition to go to space and have an astronaut flying into space,” he said. “This momentum starts developing, and I can only say it’s nice to see.”\\nAschbacher added that he didn’t think that such short-term missions, funded in Sweden’s case as part of a public-private partnership, would detract from efforts to craft a long-term human spaceflight program at the agency. “They have certainly raised the appetite and the attention, but you cannot compare a 10-day mission with a six-month mission on the space station,” he said. “But it’s a new element that we can add to our portfolio.”\\n'}\n",

The company’s first launch attempt in April saw the Tianlong-2 rocket make Space Pioneer the first Chinese commercial outfit to reach orbit with a liquid propellant launcher.\\nThe company has now raised a total of three billion Chinese yuan ($414 million) across 11 rounds since its establishment in 2018. In February the firm announced it had secured “B+” and “Pre-C” strategic funding rounds.\\nA number of the leading investors are linked to the Chinese state. These include China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a partially state-owned investment vehicle, CCB International, belonging to the China Construction Bank Corporation, and CITIC Construction, the engineering and construction arm of Chinese state-owned CITIC Group, and Zhejiang University Lianchuang. Venture capital also plays a part in the funding.\\nThe new funds will be used for the development of the Tianlong-3 kerosene-liquid oxygen launch vehicle and its engine and the construction of a dedicated launch complex at the Jiuquan national spaceport. The funds will also go towards developing mass production capabilities and recruitment.\\xa0\\nThe first launch of the Tianlong-3 rocket is currently scheduled for May 2024. It is intended to be somewhat comparable to the Falcon 9. If successful, Space Pioneer claims it will be able to launch 30 times per year from 2025.\\nTianlong-3 (“Sky Dragon-3”) is a two-stage kerosene-liquid oxygen rocket with a reusable first stage. Space Pioneer’s webpages state that the rocket will be capable of lifting 17 tons of payload to low Earth orbit, or 14 tons to 500-kilometer sun-synchronous orbit.\\xa0\\n\\xa0It will have a takeoff mass of 590 tons and produce 770 tons of thrust. The 71-meter-long Tianlong-3 will have a diameter of 3.8 meters. Previously, many commercial Chinese rockets used 2.25 or 3.35-meter-diameter stages, the dimensions as those of most Long March rockets.\\xa0\\nThe Tianlong-3 is, according to Space Pioneer, tailor-made for launching satellites for China’s national communications megaconstellation. Tianlong-3 will provide “important strategic support for the country’s new satellite Internet infrastructure,” according to the July 5 statement. The planned 13,000-strong Guowang constellation is seen as China’s answer to Starlink.\\nMore recently established Chinese commercial launch companies including Space Pioneer and OrienSpace are opting to develop much larger launch vehicles than earlier movers, which have committed to launchers with payload capacities on the order of a few thousand kilograms. This shift has been initiated by the emergence of the possibility of contracts for Guowang and commercial cargo missions.\\nSpace Pioneer says it has already signed 10 orders for launches on the Tianlong-2.\\nThe company also has plans for a Tianlong-3H, a triple-core version in the same style as the SpaceX Falcon Heavy, and the Tianlong-3M, a single core rocket tipped with a reusable spaceplane.\\nSpace Pioneer initially started out developing engines burning green monopropellant before changing direction. The firm also apparently scrapped development of the Tianlong-1 rocket.\\nThe firm has received sponsorship and investment from Zhangjiagang, a city in Jiangsu province on the Yangtze river. Space Pioneer is building rocket manufacturing facilities in the city and the Tianlong-2 launch also bore the name “Zhangjiagang.”\\nMeanwhile, fellow Chinese commercial firm Landspace is gearing up for the second launch of its Zhuque-2 methane-liquid oxygen rocket from Jiuquan.

The Ariane 5’s successor, Ariane 6, is still in development and appears increasingly unlikely to be ready for its inaugural launch before 2024. The Soyuz is no longer available in Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Vega C remains grounded after a December 2022 launch failure, and its return to flight, previously planned for late this year, is facing delays after an anomaly during a static-fire test June 28 of that rocket’s Zefiro 40 motor.\\nThe original version of the Vega, which does not use the Zefiro 40, is scheduled to resume launches in September, but most launches on the Vega manifest are of the more powerful Vega C. European startups such as Isar Aerospace and Rocket Factory Augsburg are working on small launch vehicles whose first flights could take place before the end of the year. But for larger payloads, there are few near-term options for European organizations.\\nThat situation led the European Space Agency to announce in October 2022 it was moving two missions to SpaceX’s Falcon 9. The first of those, the Euclid astronomy mission, was set to launch on Soyuz but instead lifted off on a Falcon 9 July 1 from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The Hera asteroid mission will launch on a Falcon 9 in October 2024 after being originally manifested on Ariane 6.\\nMore European missions are likely to fly on Falcon 9. At a June 29 briefing after a meeting of the ESA Council, the agency announced that the Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer, or EarthCARE, mission that has been moved from Soyuz to Vega C last October would instead likely fly on Falcon 9 in the second quarter of 2024.\\nWhile the announcement coincided with the news of the Zefiro 40 test anomaly, ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said the change was not directly linked to that but instead to the failed launch last December as well as changes in the size of EarthCARE that would have required modifications to the Vega C payload fairing to accommodate it.\\n“With these two elements, I asked my inspector general to reassess the situation,” he said at the briefing. “The conclusion of this assessment by the inspector general was recommending to me that we should not fly with Vega C.” That was based on the earlier Vega C failure review, which recommended no changes to the configuration, like the payload fairing, on the initial series of Vega C launches.\\nThe Falcon 9 payload fairing with the logos of ESA and the Euclid spacecraft. Credit: SpaceNews/Jeff Foust\\nAt the same briefing, ESA officials said they were also in discussions with SpaceX for the launch of up to four Galileo satellites on Falcon 9 vehicles. “We are moving ahead with negotiations to conclude hopefully soon with SpaceX,” said Javier Benedicto, ESA’s director of navigation. That is contingent on concluding the negotiations with SpaceX as well as securing approvals from the European Union and its security agreement with SpaceX.\\nIn a July 1 interview after the Euclid launch, Aschbacher said it will be up to the European Commission to decide when and how to launch those Galileo satellites. “We have provided all the technical information with regards to launcher compatibility, which the Commission has,” he said. “Now it’s up to them to make a decision.”\\nHe noted that Euclid was not the first time that ESA had used the Falcon 9. Sentinel-6A, also known as Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, was a joint U.S.-Europe Earth science mission launched on a Falcon 9 in November 2020. ESA astronauts have also flown on Crew Dragon missions. However, in those cases the launches were procured and overseen by NASA, not ESA.\\nAschbacher praised SpaceX for its role in launching Euclid. “SpaceX has been very proactive, very quick, very professional in providing this launch service. And I’m very happy now that this has been conducted successfully.”\\nHe reiterated past comments that the problems with Ariane 6 and Vega C and the loss of Soyuz had created a “launcher crisis” in Europe. “We are in a crisis and we should use the opportunity to convert this crisis into actions and changes that need to be adopted in order, in the future, to develop a robust launcher system for Europe,” he said, looking beyond Ariane 6 and Vega C.\\nHe also took the long view, expecting that this temporary gap in European launch capabilities will be forgotten in the long term, once Ariane 6 and Vega C are in regular operations. “Then this few months will be a blip,” he said. “Of course, now we are right in the midst of it and it’s difficult for everyone to accept the current situation. But you have to see this in the longer term.”\\n'}\n",

Gen. John Shaw said at a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies event.\\xa0\\nShaw specifically alluded to the military’s “neighborhood watch” satellites — known as GSSAP (Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program) — used to monitor the geostationary belt, where the Pentagon deploys its most valuable space assets.\\xa0\\nGSSAPs were built to last for decades but have a limited fuel supply, and maneuvers must be carefully planned to minimize fuel consumption.\\xa0\\nShaw has raised the issue at several public appearances in recent months. At the Mitchell forum, he once again insisted that the current approach of deploying satellites in designated orbits and minimizing maneuvers does not work in the age of great power competition.\\nHe said Space Command is advocating for a new approach he described as “dynamic space operations,” in contrast to the current practice of minimizing maneuvers for fear of depleting a satellite’s fuel supply.\\xa0\\n“This could be the most fundamental doctrinal shift that we’re probably going to see in the next four to five years,” he said.\\xa0\\nNeed maneuverable platforms\\nPerhaps not all satellites have to be highly maneuverable, Shaw said. But surveillance and reconnaissance platforms need to be more mobile in order to better monitor adversaries’ activities.\\xa0\\n“We launch a platform into orbit, and we tend to leave it right in that orbit,” Shaw said. “But we’re coming to the realization that that is not going to be sufficient anymore.”\\nShaw said he recently spent time with GSSAP operators at Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado. Their feedback reinforced the need for change in how these assets are developed and deployed, he added.\\n“GSSAP’s sole purpose is to move around the geosynchronous belt and to look at other platforms … And if there’s something that’s behaving suspiciously, we’ll look at that,” Shaw said.\\xa0\\nU.S. military satellites are operated to ensure they stay in service for many years or decades. “And so we are actually largely constrained by what we can do with those platforms,” he said. “I had a chance to sit down with operators a few weeks ago and spend a good amount of time understanding how they approach it.”\\nThey have to operate with significant constraints, said Shaw. “We can’t have those constraints in the future. And so we’re trying to articulate a requirement to the Space Force that we need to be able to have sustained space maneuver for those platforms.”\\nPotential solutions\\nIt will be up to the Space Force to come up with solutions to this problem, Shaw said. Among the options being considered is to build satellites with refueling ports so they can take advantage of commercial refueling services.\\xa0\\n“If I could refuel GSSAP satellites once a month, we would be operating them completely differently than we do now. They’d be operating at maximum trust levels and delta V levels that are unlike anything we’re doing right now,” Shaw said.\\nAnother possible solution is to rely on low-cost small satellites that would be replaced more frequently. “I’ll get another one in two weeks because I’m going to fly the heck out of it. And it’s going to empty that gas tank in a hurry.”\\nThe goal is to “achieve surprise and initiative against an adversary in ways that I can’t today,” Shaw added.\\xa0\\nThe Space Force is working to address these needs, he said.\\xa0\\n“We’ve asked for a demo by 2026 on how we would do sustained space maneuvers for a given platform.”\\n'}\n",

The launch had been scheduled for June 16 but was postponed a day in advance after Arianespace concluded that three pyrotechnical transmission lines used for the separation of the rocket’s solid rocket boosters needed to be replaced. The company rescheduled the launch for July 4, only to delay it an additional day because of strong upper-level winds.\\nAs with so many Ariane 5 missions, this launch, designated VA261, carried two communications satellites destined for geostationary transfer orbit. Nearly 30 minutes after liftoff, the rocket deployed Heinrich-Hertz-Satellit, a spacecraft built by OHB for the German Space Agency on behalf of other German government agencies. The 3,400-kilogram satellite will test advanced communications technologies.\\nAbout three and a half minutes later, the rocket deployed the other payload, the Syracuse 4B satellite for the French military. The 3,570-kilogram satellite was developed by a consortium of Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space, using an Airbus Eurostar 3000 bus.\\n“It is a success for ‘Team Europe’ tonight with this last and final Ariane 5,” Stéphane Israël, chief executive of Arianespace, said on the company’s webcast of the launch after confirmation of successful payload deployment.\\n“Thanks for ArianeGroup, Arianespace and CNES. It was a wonderful launch, even if it is the last one,” said Gen. Michel Sayegh, director of space programs for the French armaments agency DGA during the launch webcast.\\nThe launch was the 117th and final flight of the Ariane 5 over 27 years. The vehicle made its first, unsuccessful launch in June 1996, and suffered a partial failure on its second launch in October 1997 before an unqualified success on its third launch in October 1998. The rocket’s ability to carry two large geostationary communications satellites at once made it a key vehicle for many years in the commercial space industry during an era when geostationary communications satellites dominated the market.\\nThe European Space Agency also regularly used the rocket for several science missions as well as the launch of five Automated Transfer Vehicle cargo spacecraft to the International Space Station between 2008 and 2014. In perhaps the rocket’s highest-profile launch, it successfully launched the James Webb Space Telescope for NASA on Christmas Day 2021, delivering it on a trajectory so accurate it had the effect of significantly increasing the spacecraft’s lifetime by reducing the amount of propellant needed for trajectory correction maneuvers.\\n“Ariane 5 is now over, and Ariane 5 has perfectly finished its work and really is now a legendary launcher,” Israël said. “But Ariane 6 is coming.”\\nWaiting on Ariane 6\\nIn the lead up to the final Ariane 5 launch, Arianespace has advertised a “spaceflight continuum,” of past and future rockets, but that continuum is not necessarily continuous. The Ariane 5 overlapped with the end of the Ariane 4 rocket, which made its last launch in 2003. ESA had originally planned for a similar overlap between the end of the Ariane 5 and the introduction of its successor, the Ariane 6.\\nHowever, the development of Ariane 6 has been plagued by delays that have pushed out its first launch, once planned for 2020, by several years. In October 2022, ESA said it projected the first launch to take place in the fourth quarter of 2023, but it is increasingly likely the launch will slip into 2024.\\nExecutives with OHB, a supplier on the Ariane 6 program, said in an earnings call in May that they expected the first Ariane 6 launch to take place in early 2024, and no later than May 2024. “I am getting more and more confident we will see the first launch of Ariane 6 early next year,” Marco Fuchs, chief executive of OHB, said during the call.\\nESA and Arianespace have declined to provide an updated launch date for that inaugural mission. “Today it would be speculative to mention a launch date,” ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher said during a press briefing June 29 after an ESA Council meeting in Stockholm. “We have to go through a number of technical milestones over the summer period but I promise, after the summer in September, we will indicate a period which is the target period for the Ariane 6.”\\nThose milestones include a hot-fire test of the Ariane 6 upper stage scheduled for July at a test facility in Lampoldshausen, Germany, which will be followed by a second test in the fall to test its performance in what ESA calls “degraded cases.” Assembly of the first flight model of the Ariane 6 is planned to begin in November in French Guiana, according to an ESA update published June 8.\\n'}\n",

There are no international regulations regarding such emissions from spacecraft, in contrast to rules for terrestrial equipment.\\n“This study represents the latest effort to better understand satellite constellations’ impact on radio astronomy,” said Federico Di Vruno, co-director of the International Astronomical Union’s Center for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference and lead author of the study being published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. Astronomers had theorized that such emissions could be detected, he noted in a statement. “Our observations confirm it is measurable.”\\nIt’s unclear what effect the electromagnetic interference emissions from Starlink satellites would have on radio astronomy, but astronomers noted that it spans one frequency range between 150.05 and 153 megahertz that is protected for radio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union.\\nThe emissions do not violate any regulations, and astronomers noted that SpaceX has been willing to talk about ways to mitigate any interference. That includes design changes already made to its next generation of Starlink satellites that can reduce those emissions.\\nHowever, astronomers said that similar emissions are likely from other satellite constellations, creating additional interference. “Our simulations show that the larger the constellation, the more important this effect becomes as the radiation from all satellites adds up,” said Benjamin Winkel of the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy (MPIfR), a co-author on the study, in a statement.\\n“This makes us not only worried about the existing constellations but even more about the planned ones, and also about the absence of clear regulation that protects the radio astronomy bands from unintended radiation,” he said.\\nAstronomers have raised concerns for several years about the potential deleterious impact of satellite constellations on astronomy. That has included both the deliberate radio transmissions from such satellites as well as reflected sunlight that can interfere with optical observations.\\nIn January, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), which funds several optical and radio astronomy observatories, announced a coordination agreement with SpaceX to mitigate the impacts of Starlink satellites on astronomy. That features efforts to reduce the brightness of Starlink satellites to least magnitude 7 as well as agreeing not to transmit while passing over major radio observatories.\\nDuring a town hall session at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society June 5, NSF officials said a similar coordination agreement had been reached with OneWeb, with more details to be released in the near future.\\nAstronomers involved in this study said they hope the detection of the electromagnetic interference emissions from the Starlink satellites will encourage other operators to take steps to mitigate similar emissions from their satellites.\\n“We believe that the early recognition of this situation gives astronomy and large constellation operators an opportunity to work together on technical mitigations pro-actively, in parallel to the necessary discussions to develop suitable regulations,” said Gyula Józsa of MPIfR and Rhodes University in South Africa.\\n'}\n",

The company plans to begin monthly flights of private astronauts on that vehicle as soon as early August.\\nIt joins Blue Origin, which started flying paying customers on its New Shepard suborbital vehicle in 2021. New Shepard has been grounded after an engine problem on a September 2022 payload-only flight, although Bob Smith, chief executive of Blue Origin, said at a June 6 conference that the company would be ready to resume flights “within the next few weeks.” The company has not provided any further updates on flight plans.\\nBoth companies operate under a regulatory regime by the Federal Aviation Administration that focuses on the safety of the uninvolved public. Federal law sharply restricts the FAA’s ability to enact regulations for the safety of spaceflight participants on commercial vehicles. This restriction, called a “moratorium” by some in the field and a “learning period” by others, limits the FAA’s ability to enact such regulations to accidents that caused death or injury, or had the potential to cause death or injury.\\nThat restriction was included in the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 and, at the time, was to last eight years, giving industry time to build up flight experience upon which regulations could be based. It has been extended several times and is now currently set to expire at the end of September.\\nMany in industry have been lobbying for another extension, arguing that companies are only now beginning to fly vehicles on a routine basis, allowing them to develop that experience the restriction was designed to foster.\\n“The issue of the learning period is, should the government be limited to only regulate if there is evidence requiring regulation or should they be allowed to regulate prospectively without data, without any specific reason to regulate?” said Jim Muncy of PoliSpace during a panel discussion on the topic by the Beyond Earth Institute in May.\\nA report by the RAND Corporation in April, though, recommended that the current restrictions be allowed to expire this year. It concluded that doing so would allow the FAA and industry to move forward on developing regulations in gradual, coordinated process.\\n“It doesn’t mean we’re recommending a large stockpile of regulations immediately. In fact, it’s just the opposite,” said Bruce McClintock, senior policy researcher at RAND, during the Beyond Earth webinar. “We would broadly call this expanding the learning period to include more tools and resources.”\\nIt’s unclear if the current restriction can be extended. The House and Senate have been working on their versions of reauthorization legislation for the FAA, but neither currently includes any language about the learning period. The House Science Committee is working on a separate commercial space bill that could address the issue. However, any bill faces long odds of passage before Oct. 1.\\n“We have a divided Congress, so the ability to move an extension through may be a bit challenging this year,” said Caryn Schenewerk, president of CS Consulting who previously worked on regulatory issues for Relativity Space and SpaceX, during the webinar. Failure to achieve an extension, she said, may be less of an active decision by Congress than a side effect of broader debates between the Republican-led House and Democratic-led Senate.\\nShould the restriction expire on Oct. 1, FAA officials have said they do not have a set of regulations ready to be enacted, but are looking at ways of cooperating with industry to shorten the development time for spaceflight participant safety rules.\\nMike Moses, president of spaceline missions and safety at Virgin Galactic, said in an interview after the Galactic 01 flight he has been encouraged about discussions his company, along with Blue Origin and SpaceX, have had with the FAA on how regulations could be developed.\\n“The idea would be to take the data we’ve learned and use that to craft very specific, focused development areas,” he said, emphasizing the need for performance-based regulations given the different technical approaches those three companies are taking for human spaceflight. “One set of regulations just won’t apply to all.”\\nHe also played down any impact on the industry, or the debate on regulations, from the June 18 accident of a commercial deep-sea submersible, Titan, built and operated by OceanGate. That accident, which killed the five people on board, raised scrutiny about the level of regulation of that industry and parallels with commercial spaceflight, given both are forms of adventure tourism with similar clientele; one of the people killed on Titan, Hamish Harding, flew on Blue Origin’s New Shepard in 2022.\\nMoses said any comparison of that accident with commercial spaceflight is an “apples-to-oranges” one given that there is existing regulation of commercial spacecraft to protect the uninvolved public. “It certainly drives accountability. You’re not totally unsupervised,” he said. “It’s a very different thing in comparison to OceanGate.”\\n'}\n"
